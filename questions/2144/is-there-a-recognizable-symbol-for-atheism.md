Is there a logo or symbol for easy and definite recognition that someone or something identifies with atheism or supports atheism? Providing statistics in support for a particular logo would be a nice addition to an answer.

I would suggest going to: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Atheism_symbols

There you will find several different symbols - the two most commonly used are the ones listed as: Atheism.png

and: ScarletA.png

Hope that helps. (sorry no statistics)

Atheism needs no symbols, logos, signs, what have you.  It's not like we're a bloody football team.

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster" rel="nofollow">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> is a nice candidate, too.

<p>I always thought that the "Darwin Fish" is a good symbol for atheism:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CphJV.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>It is also similar to the "christian" fish, and it implies that atheism is an evolution step from religion.</p>

<p>The site where I took the image from shows a series of alternative symbols for Atheism:</p>

<p><a href="http://decoy.iki.fi/atheist/no-ghost-c-06" rel="nofollow">http://decoy.iki.fi/atheist/no-ghost-c-06</a></p>

<p>Here's one that is nice in that it also seems to imply a scientific bent.</p>

<p>I believe this is even used by the US gov't for the graves of atheist soldiers when desired.</p>

If you call yourself an Atheist it is to identify part of who you are and like it or not you are part of a group/team. You may disagree with the finer points of the group but you are still "in"
If you want to be no part of any team or group then dont mention the "A" word, the moment you do you are ,rightly or wrongly "grouped".

There is always the red "A" symbol (I think it was designed by the guy being sued by the Richard Dawkins Foundation?). I don't think there is anything wrong with having a symbol although some people seem to be very against the idea. I would like religious people to know what I am and it might help to know which people I might have something in common with. I know that "atheism" is actually a very loose term, but in practice there are certain characteristics that I find in atheists which group them together (mostly good things!).
