Both Dawkins and Hitchens argue that the greatest dangers posed by religion, come from fundamentalist churches, but that the more liberal religions do little more than enable the conservative ones. As a result, they (the liberal religions) are also enemies of reason and rational thought. 

If you talk to those who practice the liberal religions, they will say that they aren't enablers but rather a line of defense against the fundamentalists. Some Unitarian Universalists might even joke that their religion is effectively "atheists with children". When you look at the motives behind the shooting at the UU church in Knoxville, TN a couple of years ago, it becomes harder to rebut this assertion. 

So...  Which is it?  Should atheists support or reject the more liberal religions if we share a common goal of refuting fundamentalism?
