We already have well established dating systems. 

It's called the "Common Era", and has been in use since at least 1708 (1615 if you include the Latin equivalent - vulgaris aerae). It's numbering is identical to the Before Christ / Anno Domini notation, and neither of them have the 0 year.

So 400 BC = 400 BCE (Before Common Era).

I see no issue using a common dating system that was once based upon a religion's profit's birth. Almost all the serious Christians scholars agree that the person they identify as Jesus Christ was likely not born in 1CE, and could have been anywhere between 7 and 2 BCE. So it's effectively an entirely arbitrary start point.

The current date is the measurement of time since a particular point in the past. We are free to choose this reference point as any moment in time we want but it is arbitrary, much like the origin in mathematical models of physical systems. It doesn't matter when this point is but the dates we quote mean nothing without mentioning it.

There is, however, a convention that is assumed when talking about dates that places this origin (at the start of the next year after this was written) approximately 63462333600 seconds in the past. Also, by convention, the date is quoted in years (31557600s), months (2629800s) and days (86400s), where any additional time is ignored or quoted as the 'time'. 

A second (s) is the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.

So, from the conventional epoch (which, coincidentally, is when some Christians believe that Jesus was born) and the beginning of the next year after this was written, a caesium-133 atom could have oscillated 84504478858813332900 times.
