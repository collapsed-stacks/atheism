Are there any public figures, in the non-theistic movement or otherwise, who identify themselves as Ignostics?

Are there any who functionally act as ignostics (see the discussion [here][1]) even if they identify themselves as atheists?

<p>I don't know how prominent a figure she is, but the only fairly visible person I know of, who self-identifies as an ignostic, is <a href="http://www.juliagalef.com/" rel="nofollow">Julia Galef</a> of the <a href="http://nycskeptics.org/" rel="nofollow">New York City Skeptics</a>.  She is one of the cohosts of the weekly <a href="http://www.rationallyspeaking.org/" rel="nofollow">Rationally Speaking podcast</a>.</p>
