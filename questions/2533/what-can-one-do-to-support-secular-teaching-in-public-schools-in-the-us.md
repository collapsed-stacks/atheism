It frustrates me, that even in this day and age U.S. public schools are [still having difficulty][1] teaching evolution without giving in to pressure from creationist and intelligent design lobbyists.

What can we do as individuals to support and change our public schools, to keep science in the classroom, and theism in the church?

Keep involved with the meetings of your local school board. You don't need to attend each one, but track what they are meeting about. If the issue comes up, go to meetings, and speak up. Many of these poor decisions are made because of a vocal minority. Get other parents involved, and make them aware of upcoming meetings.

1. Support the [National Center for Science Education](http://ncse.org)
2. Go to school board meetings, especially where curriculum is being discussed, and be heard
3. Write your legislators and/or committee members whenever education standards are being discussed

<p>Be aware that there are many religious organizations that support science education, and not just the new-agey kind. You don't have to agree with everything they say but they can make great partners. If the creationists are the only ones at the meetings saying "they represent God", the conversation will be skewed. If you have someone there saying they believe that God speaks in a language of math and facts and is revealing the universe to us through our ability to explore, some of the fire will be taken out of there statements.</p>
