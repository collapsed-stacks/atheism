I know "belief in anything `god` or `God` disqualifies antheism", but assuming I don't worship / acknowledge any of those, but then revere the self, do I get labeled an `atheist`?

Not that I want to be, but am wondering how accurate such a label would be in case someone used it to classify me.

(forgive any ambiguities, am not good with words)

Atheists don't believe in god or gods of any kind. If you believe you *are* god then you are not an atheist but probably are in need of psychiatric care.

Can you break the natural laws? Can you bring back the dead? No. You are not a God but if you believe you are then you are not an Atheist.
