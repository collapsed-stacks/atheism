Since the question is explicitly “what every *atheist* should read”, I assume that it’s not a book that should convince me of atheism. Rather, it should give me an edge when *arguing for* atheism.

In that regard, I think ***The God Delusion* by Richard Dawkins** really takes the price. Some call it shrill, I call it frank. But more importantly, it offers some very hard to refute arguments in a very clear and concise manner. In particular, it completely disembowels agnosticism.

In the US? **The Bible.**

It has, without a doubt, done more to turn me away from Christianity than anything else.

***The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins**.  This isn't a book about atheism, and the author really doesn't come out strongly as such (in this book).  But for me this one opened my eyes: before that I'd been a wimpy agnostic. This book doesn't convince by argument so much as by wonder: Here is the world explained, rational, logical, and explicable, without the need for a single supernatural force or sky-hook. 

People think Dawkins is just a big angry Atheist, and I admire that side of him, but if you read his earlier work you'll see where all of that comes from- an absolute confidence and deep knowledge of the real world and the real wonders it provides, which are never miracles, and only get trivialized by naming them as such.

<p>I would have to answer <strong><em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0307265773" rel="nofollow">Letter To a Christan Nation</a></em> by Sam Harris</strong>. It is rather scathing, but makes many good points, and does so in a rather short page length. A great book to read if you don't have much time to sit down and read a full 400 pages or more..  "Christian Nation" is essentially a distilled 93 pages drawn from Harris' "The End of Faith" and Christian responses to it. </p>

<p>This book aims to explain the roots of religion in as neutral a manner as possible. As the subtitle states, it treats "religion as a natural phenomenon". It gives good insights into the evolution and psychology of religion. </p>

**Steven Pinker's *How the Mind Works*** provides wonderful insight into our current understanding of human psychology, including how it is presumed to have evolved. The first few chapters dealing with neural networks bore the crap out of me, but I was enthralled by the rest.

God the Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows That God Does Not Exist by Victor J. Stenger.  

As the emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Hawaii, Stenger explores the problem of the existence of God from a Physicist's point of view arguing that, if he/she/it truly existed, then there should be some evidence out in the Universe.  Having argued throughout the book that this is clearly not the case, he concludes that life, the Universe and everything is the way it is because no Gods exist or have ever existed.

When it comes to Atheistic topics, "Why I am not a Christian" by Bertrand Russell is a good one. There are certainly several concepts like the celestial teapot, which Russell introduces to help one understand agnosticism in a non-threatening manner.

Paine's "The Age of Reason" might be second on my list, of 'classic' literature. -- by that I mean people who have passed on.

I vote for the Bible as well. It's a fine work of literature and the King James version contains much that has influenced our language and culture. A recent survey showed that atheists tended to know more about the Bible and other religions than most people who professed a religion, and knowing your scripture is always handy when you are in a debate with somebody.

<p>To group all religions under Belief System, or B.S., I would recommend <strong><em>Prometheus Rising</em> by Robert Anton Wilson</strong> as it looks at all religions.</p>

I recommend reading Bertrand Russell's '[The Scientific Outlook](http://books.google.be/books?id=cV7Zo8z4tDwC&dq=the+scientific+outlook&source=gbs_navlinks_s)' and '[Religion and Science](http://books.google.be/books?id=RRr1aX3W9e0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:ISBN0195115511)', which though not specifically about atheism, make clear why religion is untenable in the face of reason and science. Any atheist who has not a solid scientific background, but even those who have will enjoy and learn from these lectures.

For people who can read French, I strongly recommend Jean Bricmont's '[Science et religion : l'irréductible antagonisme](http://www.dogma.lu/txt/JB-Science01.htm)'.

**Origin of species** by Charles Darwin.

Why:

It's probably the most influential book in the history of atheism, because it explained the origins of mankind without any supernatural intervention. It's not the best book on evolution, nowdays, but I believe it's a must read for every atheist - as far as there can be "must read" books at all.

I don't really care about books that give arguments in favor of atheism, like the Gods Delusion. They don't give you anything simple common sense couldn't. And as for fancy stuff that could be used in debates... I don't care about that either. My debates are short. Show me your god, then we talk. Until then. Burden of proof, pal, burden of proof. I don't need no fancy arguments, it's theists that need them.

So, **Origin of species**.
