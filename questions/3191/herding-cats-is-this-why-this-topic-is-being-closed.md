Is the closure of this topic due to the "herding cats" syndrome that we atheists are meant to suffer from?

Personally I think that being an Atheist is not a complex question, religious people wont come here to learn by the very fact that they are religious. It looks like to me that this has been kept going by atheists for atheists and that is its inherent flaw.

Thanks guys, I did learn something. It was fun.
