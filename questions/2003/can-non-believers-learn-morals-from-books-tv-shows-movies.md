As an atheist, I've often been asked by religious friends where I get my moral compass.  Obviously, a certain amount of moral values were instilled in me by my parents and family, but if I really think back to my childhood, I feel that TV shows, movies, and books may have had a lot to do with how I grew up.

I even feel like I can pinpoint where I learned about certain concepts, and grew to respect certain values.  For example:

 - Sesame Street - Empathy, caring for others, sharing emotions
 - The Cosby Show / Family Ties- Family values, loyalty
 - Star Wars & Fantasy Books - Courage, good vs. evil
 - Mash - The human condition
 - Heinlein/Asimov - Sociological awareness, respect for education, scientific analysis

These influences run from when I was a small child all the way through to adulthood, and many of these shows/movies/books still have an effect on me today.

So, if religious folks claim that their moral values are rooted in faith, is is possible/likely that an atheists moral values come from media, in addition to family/etc?

I'd be interested in hearing about both anecdotal evidence or scientific/sociological studies on the matter.
