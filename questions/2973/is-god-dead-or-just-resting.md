Presumably your mileage is going to vary depending on where you are writing, but I want to pose this question globally insofar as that is possible. How far have we come in terms of moving beyond God as a species and what metric do you use to qualify your claim?

In other words, is the world still basically as religious as it has ever been? Has there been progress moving beyond theistic images of thought?
