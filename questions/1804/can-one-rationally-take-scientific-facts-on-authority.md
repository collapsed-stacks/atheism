"Argument from authority" is a common fallacy, however, ultimately my understanding of science is entirely founded in authority.

The authority's source is not a single person but a community, whom I've grown to trust for providing a large quantity of consistent theories that yield testable novel predictions and applicable technologies, and it's those latter things that support my faith in their authority on the question of how the universe works.

However, it's not too hard to imagine a world in which **this exact process** would lead me to believe the theists and their theories. Following this process in the medieval times would certainly get me calling Galileo or Kepler a lunatic.

By "this process" I mean: collect all the available information, see if it's consistent with the proposed theories and the (extremely limited!) observations I made myself, apply some "probabilistic logic", and decide which one I find the most likely.

Clearly, this process is not perfect. Among other things, one failure mode would be if all the media were censored in a huge conspiracy, and all the experiments and results I read about were just made-up stories designed to make me believe in quantum physics or relativity.

And yet, short of performing all the experiments for myself, I cannot think of a better approach. Is heavy reliance on media an acceptable process for selecting one's set of world theories? How do I know where to draw the line?
