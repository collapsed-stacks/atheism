I live in an area which is heavily (60% or more) one religion. It is generally assumed, in my neighborhood, that everyone is of that same religion. I frequently come home to find invitations to various activities (dinners, meetings, etc.) taped to my door. Less frequently, people will approach me with religious conversation or asking for donations.

I am not hesitant to explain that I am atheist, and sometimes enjoy the reaction, but I don't want to appear rude or argumentative. I simply want them to understand and leave it alone.

Instead, many of these people then escalate their attempts to "reach out" and contact me. They usually offer to send missionaries, engage in further conversation in hopes of conversion, or extend invitations to their religious meetings, etc. I have no interest in pursuing a religious discovery, nor in arguing with them about our differences in belief.

Which highly effective ways are there to get this message across,  without inviting argument or seeming extremely off-putting?
