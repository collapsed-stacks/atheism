## How can I, as a staunch materialist, understand the thinking behind idealism (and hence, theism) when they talk in terms that are alien to me?

I know very little about philosophy, so my understanding of this is probably rudimentary, inaccurate and naive, but maybe some of you have some insight.

The way I understand it, there are two fundamentally different ways of perceiving/analysing existence. 

 - **Materialism** is a broad category of philosophies which assert that the fundamental building block of nature is *matter*, and that everything we experience — including consciousness — is a consequence of complex interactions of matter, i.e. an emergent property

 - **Idealism**, if I understand it right, is the competing set of philosophies in which consciousness (or “mind” or “soul” or whatever you wanna call it) is granted fundamentality status, and which maintains that the existence of matter is predicated on the presence of a conscious observer. 

Feel free to rip these definitions to shreds, but if you do, please pay attention to the rest of my question nonetheless.

As the argument goes, everyone makes an implicit assumption (called an *ontological commitment*) either one way or the other, whether they know it or not (until they are made aware of the dichotomy and start thinking about it). Now, it is my understanding that there is a strong correlation between (initial) materialism and atheism, and between (initial) idealism and theism.

Further, I am told, both fundamental ways of thinking are incompatible; so incompatible, in fact, that people from both groups violently talk past each other because they talk in terms of concepts that are completely alien to the other. (To give two examples: the typical atheist, who is typically a materialist, cannot understand how a theist can argue that a creator must exist to explain the first cause, yet the creator itself doesn’t need a cause; at the same time, the typical theist, who is typically an idealist, cannot understand how the materialist can be contented with an explanation that requires matter to “come from nothing”.)

**Here is my question:** How can I, as a staunch materialist, understand the thinking behind idealism (and hence, theism) without having to listen to (or read) idealists, whom I don’t understand because they talk in terms that are alien to me?
