I know very little about philosophy, so my understanding of this is probably rudimentary, inaccurate and naive, but maybe some of you have some insight.

The way I understand it, there are two fundamentally different ways of perceiving/analysing existence. 

 - **Materialism** is a broad category of philosophies which assert that the fundamental building block of nature is *matter*, and that everything we experience — including consciousness — is a consequence of complex interactions of matter, i.e. an emergent property

 - **Idealism**, if I understand it right, is the competing set of philosophies in which consciousness (or “mind” or “soul” or whatever you wanna call it) is granted fundamentality status, and which maintains that the existence of matter is predicated on the presence of a conscious observer. 

Feel free to rip these definitions to shreds, but if you do, please pay attention to the rest of my question nonetheless.

As the argument goes, everyone makes an implicit assumption (called an *ontological commitment*) either one way or the other, whether they know it or not (until they are made aware of the dichotomy and start thinking about it). Now, it is my understanding that there is a strong correlation between (initial) materialism and atheism, and between (initial) idealism and theism.

Further, I am told, both fundamental ways of thinking are incompatible; so incompatible, in fact, that people from both groups violently talk past each other because they talk in terms of concepts that are completely alien to the other. (To give two examples: the typical atheist, who is typically a materialist, cannot understand how a theist can argue that a creator must exist to explain the first cause, yet the creator itself doesn’t need a cause; at the same time, the typical theist, who is typically an idealist, cannot understand how the materialist can be contented with an explanation that requires matter to “come from nothing”.)

**Here is my question:** How can I, as a staunch materialist, understand the thinking behind idealism (and hence, theism) without having to listen to (or read) idealists, whom I don’t understand because they talk in terms that are alien to me?

<p>The debate may seem like an argument over the veracity of materialism or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_naturalism" rel="nofollow">metaphysical naturalism</a> but this is actually a debate over what constitutes a valid explanation; it's a debate over the validity of faith. </p>

<p>Atheists usually know of faith only because we've been introduced to it by theists. Faith, the belief in something without evidence, is usually not part of an atheist's world view (and for the rest of this post, that's the kind of atheist I will refer to whenever I will use the term atheist unless I explicitly). </p>

<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/11m/atheism_untheism_antitheism/" rel="nofollow">As Eliezer Yudkowsky once said</a>, if someone from a society which has never developed supernatural beliefs has a discussion with a theist, it would probably look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The universe was created by God -"</p>
  
  <p>"By what?"</p>
  
  <p>"By a, ah, um, God is the Creator -
  the Mind that chose to make the
  universe -"</p>
  
  <p>"So the universe was created by an
  intelligent agent.  Well, that's the
  standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">Simulation Hypothesis</a>, but do
  you have actual evidence confirming
  this?  You sounded very certain -"</p>
  
  <p>"No, not like the Matrix!  God isn't
  in another universe simulating this
  one, God just... is.  He's
  indescribable.  He's the First Cause,
  the Creator of everything -"</p>
  
  <p>"Okay, that sounds like you just
  postulated an ontologically basic
  mental entity.  And you offered <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/" rel="nofollow">a mysterious answer to a mysterious question</a>.  Besides, where are you
  getting all this stuff?  Could you
  maybe start by telling us about your
  evidence - the new observation you're
  trying to interpret?"</p>
  
  <p>"I don't need any evidence!  I have
  faith!"</p>
  
  <p>"You have <em>what?</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
To an atheist, faith being a valid justification is not an intelligible concept. We understand what people mean by that but we don't understand how it's a valid explanation of one's belief. </p>

<p>We're not alone in that, by the way. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn" rel="nofollow">Invisible Pink Unicorn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot" rel="nofollow">Russell's teapot</a>, Santa Claus, and the Tooth Fairy demonstrate, all humans do not consider faith without evidence to justify a belief <em>except when it comes to religion</em>, where belief without evidence is deemed reasonable.</p>

<p>While that may seem like special pleading to an atheist ("Why do you believe in your god but not Santa Claus?"), it isn't. Theists almost always believe that their religious beliefs best explain something about the Universe. Perhaps it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument" rel="nofollow">why something exists</a> rather than nothing, or the level of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument" rel="nofollow">complexity in the Universe</a>, or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_morality" rel="nofollow">origin of morality</a> but, whatever it is, a theist will feel that his or her religious belief best explains what they know of the Universe.</p>

<p>Atheists will disagree over the validity of that explanation and <em>that</em> is where the real disagreement is. Atheists feel that gods do not meet <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11046" rel="nofollow">the criteria for a good explanation</a>: <b></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Testability:</b> Better explanations render specific predictions that can be falsified or corroborated.<b></li>
  <li>Scope (aka “comprehensiveness”):</b> Better explanations explain more types of phenomena.<b></li>
  <li>Precision:</b> Better explanations explain phenomena with greater precision.<b></li>
  <li>Simplicity:</b> Better explanations make use of fewer claims, especially fewer as yet unsupported claims (“lack of ad-hoc-ness”).<b></li>
  <li>Mechanism:</b> Better explanations provide more information about underlying mechanisms.<b></li>
  <li>Unification:</b> Better explanations unify apparently disparate phenomena (also sometimes called “consilience”).<b></li>
  <li>Predictive novelty:</b> Better explanations don’t just “retrodict” what we already know, but predict things we observe only after they are predicted.<b></li>
  <li>Analogy (aka “fit with background knowledge”): </b>Better explanations generally fit with what we already know with some certainty.<b></li>
  <li>Past explanatory success:</b> Better explanations fit within a tradition or trend with past explanatory success (e.g. astronomy, not astrology).</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>To atheists, a god is a complex, untestable hypothesis that violate many of the laws we know govern the physical world and offer no predictions. As such, it is a bad explanation and thus is abandoned. </p>

<p>That is the core difference between the two world views: different views of what makes a valid explanation for the unknown. A theist's views will be coherent <em>if</em> you grant their standard of what qualifies as a good explanation. Everything else in their worldview is decided according to that one single assumption. It's because you do not grant them or realize the presence of that first assumption that their views seem illogical or incomprehensible.  </p>

<p>Note that, while I used atheist and theist here, the terms can be easily replaced by materialist and dualist. The above explanation applies to nearly all conflicts where one party believes in the supernatural while the other does not.</p>

<p>It might be best to understand Dualism, the explanation of the world that does not reduce all things to solely material existence, by understanding what it seeks to explain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two important concepts deployed in this notion. One is that of substance, the other is the dualism of these substances. A substance is characterized by its properties, but, according to those who believe in substances, it is more than the collection of the properties it possesses, it is the thing which possesses them. So the mind is not just a collection of thoughts, but is that which thinks, an immaterial substance over and above its immaterial states. Properties are the properties of objects. If one is a property dualist, one may wonder what kinds of objects possess the irreducible or immaterial properties in which one believes... Now one might try to think of these subjects as just bundles of the immaterial states. This is Hume's view. But if one thinks that the owner of these states is something quite over and above the states themselves, and is immaterial, as they are, one will be a substance dualist. (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#SubDua" rel="nofollow">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that someone would, from the perspective of a materialist, contrive or conjure up such a system is evidence of the person trying to interpret the world around them. It is not a defect of their reasoning, instead it is typically argued that there is a cognitive dissonance in the concept of materialist claims to knowledge, principally that they have no intuitive understanding of qualitative knowledge. Here is an example from the SEP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[I]magine a future scientist who has lacked a certain sensory modality from birth, but who has acquired a perfect scientific understanding of how this modality operates in others. This scientist — call him Harpo — may have been born stone deaf, but become the world's greatest expert on the machinery of hearing: he knows everything that there is to know within the range of the physical and behavioural sciences about hearing. Suppose that Harpo, thanks to developments in neurosurgery, has an operation which finally enables him to hear. It is suggested that he will then learn something he did not know before, which can be expressed as what it is like to hear, or the qualitative or phenomenal nature of sound. These qualitative features of experience are generally referred to as qualia. If Harpo learns something new, he did not know everything before. He knew all the physical facts before. So what he learns on coming to hear — the facts about the nature of experience or the nature of qualia — are non-physical. This establishes at least a state or property dualism. (See Jackson (1982); Robinson (1982)) (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#ArgForDua" rel="nofollow">cit. SEP</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frequently, people who cannot commit to the ontological leap of materialism are often hung up on the <em>qualia</em> mentioned above. A materialist rebuttal is often, "there's an up until now uncalculated variable for that." The dualist riposte is "intuitively speaking, the idea of being able to know all things a priori, as a matter of variables, without experiencing them sounds far fetched."</p>

I don't think you can.  They've never developed any reasonably consistent language to describe their theories.  They borrow and contort the language used by material, scientific theories and mix it in with ancient terms that clearly have no solid definition.  For instance, they use the word "energy" but have no understanding of it at all; to them it's some sort of stuff that their spirit crap can be made up of.  When you try to explain to them that energy is just a variable within a physical model describing how matter moves they're like, "Wha??"

Quantum mechanics is another example.  They took the idea of the observer effect, which they have absolutely no understanding of, and contorted the language of materialism to their own ends.

They have no language of their own and when you try to figure out what they mean by things you more often than not find out that they don't even know.  When you ask, "What do you mean by using the word 'energy' because your statements about it make no sense to me," they're almost certain to refer to physics, not anything from their own 'science'.

I'm of firm belief that there is literally nothing to understand.  Their statements don't actually mean anything about anything.  They speak in nonsenses and, in fact, often do so quite purposefully.

The best you might do is study Plato because when all is said and done, they're all his followers and don't really have anything new to say.

The question sort of answers itself. You can't understand something if you don't listen to it and read up on it. You have an advantage because there are many that have already done the work and left you with good starting points, so you can begin your study with a fair amount of certainty that you are confirming what you already know. 

For example, you no doubt believe Revelations is allegory, not an actual prediction of the end times that can be deciphered. Take a few minutes and read it and you can confirm that. Trouble is, someone comes along and says that you need to understand the symbolism, or you need to read everything Calvin wrote, and you're wondering how you get around that. You are fairly certain that no matter how many of the symbols you can trace or how many interpretations you read, you are not going to be able to demonstrate the inconsistencies and prove that Revelations is not whatever this idealist says it is. And your right. That's how theology works. You would prove it to yourself, but you knew it with just a cursory look. Theology relies on people accepting something is true without evidence. 

As Daniel Dennett puts it “Theology is a way of not coming clean about the whole enterprise.”
It relies on making propositions that seem to be profound, but only because it is actually logically ill-formed. These propositions have 2 readings:
  On one, it is true but trivial
  On the other, it is false, but would be earth-shattering if it were true
An example would be "love is just a word". True, it is a word, and if that's all it was, that would be earth shattering. But love is much more than that and we get to live in the world where it is hard to define and we have to struggle with that. But a theologian tries to get around questions of god's existence and says things like, "god is no being at all" and goes on selling books while you try to work out through the logic of that. 

The good news is, in most cases, there is an easy way out. Just ask the person if they have read Revelations, or whatever they are using as evidence for how their thinking is valid. Most won't have, they are just repeating what someone else said, and you ask who that is. If they have read it, ask for more specifics. They will be vague. If they are specific, you will note the inconsistencies in their line of reasoning, and if you ask for clarification, they will either interrupt you or get the point that you aren't going to accept their reasoning. 

So, that's how I handle trying to understand the thinking of people who are right in front of me. To understand how so many human beings came to think this way, you will have to study. If you figure it out, let us know.

There are many things that are explained in terms of some field-specific vocabulary, and it makes sense from an efficiency point of view.

Typically the choices are: find a popular adaptation, which invariably loses the (often rather important) detail, or invest the time and actually learn and understand the field-specific vocabulary.

I prefer the latter for fields I'm interested in because there is a limitation on how far a popular explanation can really go.

"The thinking behind idealism", at least idealism which claims that matter/energy is not a necessary prerequisite of “mind” or “soul” or whatever you wanna call it", can only be explained as delusional. 

There exists only matter/energy and without matter/energy no entity, no thought, no emotion, no "spirituality" can exist no matter how hard they wish for it.
