I'm in a spirited email discussion with a theist, who claims that the government co-opted marriage from religion, which originated it. I'm reasonably sure this is backwards: marriage started as a civil business arrangement, outside religious sacraments or blessings, and eventually the ceremonies were added on top and have now become the focus. Where can I find some data to back me up?
