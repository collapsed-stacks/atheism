## When did marriage go from being a business contract to a religious ceremony?

I'm in a spirited email discussion with a theist, who claims that the government co-opted marriage from religion, which originated it. I'm reasonably sure this is backwards: marriage started as a civil business arrangement, outside religious sacraments or blessings, and eventually the ceremonies were added on top and have now become the focus. Where can I find some data to back me up?

<p>While not an authoritative source, <a href="http://www.jeffgoode.com/politicalsatire/traditionalmarriage.htm" rel="nofollow">according to the research playwright Jeff Goode did while preparing a script for the Renaissance Festival of Kansas City</a>, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the tradition of
  marriage-as-we-know-it simply did not
  exist in those days. Almost everything
  we have come to associate with
  marriage and weddings -- the white
  dress, the holy vows, the fancy cake
  and the birdseed -- dates back a mere
  50 or 100 years at the most. In many
  cases less.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>It turns out that marriage, in days of
  old, was a barbaric custom which was
  little more than a crude exchange of
  livestock at its most civilized, and a
  little less than ritualized abduction
  at its worst. That's why you'll find
  no reference to white weddings in the
  Bible, or the union of one man and one
  woman. Because up until fairly
  recently, there was nothing religious
  about it.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>The truth is that marriage has always
  been more a secular tradition rather
  than a religious one. Up until the
  early Renaissance, in fact, couples
  were traditionally married on the
  church's front doorstep, because
  wedding ceremonies were considered too
  vulgar to be performed inside the
  building: After all, there was implied
  sex in the vows and shameless public
  displays of affection. No clergyman in
  his right mind would have allowed such
  an unholy abomination on the premises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then there's this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...in the 1800s when the sole purpose of
  marriage was procreation and
  housekeeping, marriage between an
  older man and a hard-working tween
  girl was considered perfectly normal.
  Today we call it pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article has some more detail, but unfortunately no references.</p>

Your mistake is thinking that there was a difference, back in the day. The separation of church and state is a modern idea. In the past they were often the same thing, so the religious ceremony was legally binding.

If you want to be pedantic (which, of course, you do), you could argue that 'marriage' pre-dates religion and 'the law' by far, if you are willing to divest the term of any of the hand-waving and spell-muttering that religion has festooned it with. Humans formed life-long mating pairs for thousands of years before religion came along. What is marriage if not a life-long pairing?

Marriage was a Biblical issue LONG before it was a political one
