On every site I introduce myself as a believer in Flying Spaghetti Monster. Do you think this may attract more believers of mainstream religions to research the subject or it's better to introduce myself as an atheist so that they don't think I'm going nuts.

<p>When talking to religious fundamentalists or just ignorant people of faith, they will often think you're nuts if you simply say that you are an atheist (it's well known that atheists have no souls, no morals, and are the spawn of the devil).</p>

<p>But on a more serious note, I watched a recent lecture of Richard Dawkins in Australia on <a href="http://fora.tv" rel="nofollow">FORA.tv</a>, and during the Q&amp;A section, a gentleman asked about whether it's Okay to teach children that religion is "a load of bullshit". Richard Dawkins discussed in response the two schools of thought of atheism.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the specific question (chapter 19, Q3), but you can also watch the entire lecture here:
