A lot of religious and fundamental websites seek to draw a distinction between, as they call them, "old atheists" and "new atheists" (or as PZ Myers calls it, "gnu atheists"), implying that there's something ... different about modern atheists, compared with those who declared a lack of faith in a god from prior generations.

It is with this question in mind that I ask, how, exactly, are we as atheists different from those who came before us?  Notwithstanding additional scientific understanding that past generations didn't enjoy, the fact that there's more of us, and the ability of the internet to network and bring us together, I can't really come up with anything.
