People use it often enough, and online it's easy to pull out one of the many counter arguments and nail it. It's not as easy in a heated debate in person, though.

I'm looking for something that's:  

 - Concise - The fewer words and more clear the better.  
 - Memorable - Something that can be committed to memory and accessed without a lot of fuss.  
 - Understandable - So the conversation can move on without a lot of explanation.
 - Compelling - It has to eliminate Pascal's Wager as a debatable point (mostly).

I'm usually quick and eloquent, but this is a topic that has so many counter arguments and varying levels of complexity that it's sometimes tough to clearly and concisely argue against in a debate without completely sidetracking the conversation.

Edit: It might seem odd that I'm accepting the longest answer when I asked for it to be concise. I've considered it and there are two things that pushed me over the edge on it. 1) His individual criticisms aren't any bigger than the other answers, but he manages to deliver five that are clear and well-presented. 2) My requirements may not have been as sane or well thought out as I believed they were.
