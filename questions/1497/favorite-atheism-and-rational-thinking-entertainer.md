Delivering ideas in an entertaining form is one way to spread them. I find that it's easier to spread certain ideas when presented in an entertaining format than when they are delivered in a dry, factual way.

I have a couple of entertainers in mind, but I won't mention them to avoid biasing answers. I'd love to find out about others though.

Please **one entertainer per answer** so that they can be voted for properly.

Stephen Fry comes to mind rather quickly. While not an atheist, he is a secular humanist, which I include in any list of rationalists. His critique of the Catholic Church a while ago was cutting to say the least, he called them a force for evil in the world and blamed them for the exacerbation of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. 

Here's the video:

Just one? It's hard. I think you can put **Pen & Teller** under "one name" :)

Hands down:  **Tim Minchin**.  

View the following titles on YouTube for a smattering of his appeal:

The Good Book  
Tony the Fish  
Storm  
Confessions  
The Pope Song  

Brilliant pianist, and "Storm" may be some of the most brilliantly distilled writing I've ever read/heard on the topic.

Other Brilliant works:  
White wine in the sun (basically an atheist Christmas carol)  
If I didn't have you  (a song about the statistical likelihood of love.)
