Delivering ideas in an entertaining form is one way to spread them. I find that it's easier to spread certain ideas when presented in an entertaining format than when they are delivered in a dry, factual way.

I have a couple of entertainers in mind, but I won't mention them to avoid biasing answers. I'd love to find out about others though.

Please **one entertainer per answer** so that they can be voted for properly.
