Most religions, as far as I know, describe what will happen to you after you die. However, if you are an atheist, you are on your own: you have no book, congregation or deity to tell you what will happen. *Just* science and rational thought.

How does this influence your feelings about death? Do you still fear death? Why, or why not?
