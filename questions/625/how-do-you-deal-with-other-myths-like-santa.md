Seeing nothing religious in Christmas (except the name) I love to celebrate it with a tree and the story of Santa and his elves just for the pure joy of family togetherness and gifts.
I have told my children that Santa is fake and they know the gifts come from their parents but I did stress the idea that it is a fun make-belief story which adds a lot of fun to the holidays and therefore they still "play along".
We do the same thing with the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.

How do YOU deal with other myths beside religion and do you actually participate in any of them?
