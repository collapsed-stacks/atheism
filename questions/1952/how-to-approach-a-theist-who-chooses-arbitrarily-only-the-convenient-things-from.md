## How to approach a theist who chooses arbitrarily only the convenient things from the Bible?

There is a person I sometimes speak to who always appeals to the Bible to "prove" any of his points or to explain the reasons for thinking a certain way. But pointing out any of the Bible's problems, inconsistencies and morally questionable stuff has exactly zero effect, because this person chooses to pick only the things he deems worthy of following, and arbitrarily "un-follows" all the nasty stuff.

So, for example, asking "why do you pray every day" or "why do you believe in heaven" gets a "because the Bible says so"; asking "why do you believe anything from the Bible" gets an "it's obviously the source of all truth" (and this answer itself can't be argued about; it's just simply assumed universally true). Pointing out a problem in the Bible gets me an "oh, that bit I don't adhere to / believe in because it was written later / mistranslated / obviously stupid".

I am at a complete loss. It's like talking to someone who doesn't have a brain and yet can talk somehow.

Is there some approach to convince this type of theist of anything, or is this a complete waste of time?
