I have a been a United States permanent resident for several years and am intending to apply for United States citizenship as soon as I become eligible. For reasons that should be clear, given my membership of this discussion forum, I really don't want to have to recite the standard naturalization oath given its reference to a deity (see http://www.immihelp.com/citizenship/naturalization-oath-ceremony.html). It is possible to recite a modified oath that omits the reference to God:

> 8 C.F.R. 337.1 provides that the
> phrase "so help me God" is optional
> and that the words "on oath" can be
> substituted with "and solemnly
> affirm". Also, if the prospective
> citizen can prove such commitments are
> in violation with his or her religion,
> the lines "that I will bear arms on
> behalf of the United States when
> required by law; that I will perform
> non-combatant service in the Armed
> Forces of the United States when
> required by law" are sometimes
> omitted.

Proving that this is in violation of my religion given that I have no religion seems problematic. In practice, has anybody experienced any difficulties using a modified oath of naturalization?
