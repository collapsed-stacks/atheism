## Is empathy just as irrational as belief in God?

This questions sounds easy, so bear with me here.  As a hard core materialist (and as a programmer who has written "machine learning" algorithms that are logical equivalents to pleasure and pain), this is the  concept that I have the most trouble with.

From an atheist point of view, the main reason that religious people "know" that there is a God, is that they were indoctrinated to believe in him when they were too young to subject that belief to rational scrutiny. Rationally those people might say "there is no evidence." They might even understand and accept that the capacity for belief in God may have had survival benefits in their ancestors, so, true or not, human brains evolved that capacity.  Nevertheless, they can't let go of something that became deeply embedded in their view of the world starting when they were toddlers.  No matter how they try, they can't rationalize it away, and they generally wouldn't want to.

As atheists, we tend to see that as a weakness...

However, most of us -- atheists included -- "know" that it is wrong to torture a kitten, but that you can't be similarly cruel to a man-made machine. And the reasons we know this seem (to me) almost identical to the above: i.e. right and wrong were taught to us when we were too young to question it, a capacity for empathy (specifically toward humans and animals) evolved into humans because it had survival benefits to our ancestors, etc.  Rationally, we can acknowledge that the kitten's brain is essentially a computer, that pain is not supernatural, and that there is no technical reason the kitten's sensation of pain is fundamentally different than whatever happens in a robot or other man-made machine when it is forced into a situation that it is programmed to attempt to avoid.

But still....we just *know* that there is something different about the kitten.  Even though there isn't a shred of scientific evidence to support the idea that there is more to pain than a certain kind of computational process, we can't, and don't want to, rationalize away our aversion to being cruel to kittens, nor can we rationalize into existence a similar feeling toward certain machines.

What is the difference?  Is empathy an irrational weakness, and if not, why not?

***Edit:*** I was asked to edit this with some things that I clarified in the comments below.  I won't try to get everything, but for now, I'll add my definition of "pain," because I think it is important to this discussion.  

Note that my definition is not circular (it doesn't use words like "dislike", "unpleasant",  "hurt", "unhappy" or "bad", nor their opposites) nor subjective (doesn't use words like "experience", "feeling", "sensation", "conscious" or "qualia") nor specific to biology (nothing about neurotransmitters!).  Due to those requirements, though, it tends to contrast with our intuitive notion of pain, in that it can apply as easily to software programs as it can to animals.

**Pain:** in a goal-oriented entity that can learn based upon the results of past behavior, the process of suppressing previously followed decision paths so that they are less likely to be followed in the future.
