This questions sounds easy, so bear with me here.  As a hard core materialist (and as a programmer who has written "machine learning" algorithms that are logical equivalents to pleasure and pain), this is the  concept that I have the most trouble with.

From an atheist point of view, the main reason that religious people "know" that there is a God, is that they were indoctrinated to believe in him when they were too young to subject that belief to rational scrutiny. Rationally those people might say "there is no evidence." They might even understand and accept that the capacity for belief in God may have had survival benefits in their ancestors, so, true or not, human brains evolved that capacity.  Nevertheless, they can't let go of something that became deeply embedded in their view of the world starting when they were toddlers.  No matter how they try, they can't rationalize it away, and they generally wouldn't want to.

As atheists, we tend to see that as a weakness...

However, most of us -- atheists included -- "know" that it is wrong to torture a kitten, but that you can't be similarly cruel to a man-made machine. And the reasons we know this seem (to me) almost identical to the above: i.e. right and wrong were taught to us when we were too young to question it, a capacity for empathy (specifically toward humans and animals) evolved into humans because it had survival benefits to our ancestors, etc.  Rationally, we can acknowledge that the kitten's brain is essentially a computer, that pain is not supernatural, and that there is no technical reason the kitten's sensation of pain is fundamentally different than whatever happens in a robot or other man-made machine when it is forced into a situation that it is programmed to attempt to avoid.

But still....we just *know* that there is something different about the kitten.  Even though there isn't a shred of scientific evidence to support the idea that there is more to pain than a certain kind of computational process, we can't, and don't want to, rationalize away our aversion to being cruel to kittens, nor can we rationalize into existence a similar feeling toward certain machines.

What is the difference?  Is empathy an irrational weakness, and if not, why not?

***Edit:*** I was asked to edit this with some things that I clarified in the comments below.  I won't try to get everything, but for now, I'll add my definition of "pain," because I think it is important to this discussion.  

Note that my definition is not circular (it doesn't use words like "dislike", "unpleasant",  "hurt", "unhappy" or "bad", nor their opposites) nor subjective (doesn't use words like "experience", "feeling", "sensation", "conscious" or "qualia") nor specific to biology (nothing about neurotransmitters!).  Due to those requirements, though, it tends to contrast with our intuitive notion of pain, in that it can apply as easily to software programs as it can to animals.

**Pain:** in a goal-oriented entity that can learn based upon the results of past behavior, the process of suppressing previously followed decision paths so that they are less likely to be followed in the future.

You might similarly ask if *any* emotional experience is irrational. It's certainly possible to develop maladaptive emotional responses, such as exploding in a fit of jealous rage when your girlfriend smiles at another guy. That's irrational because smiling at someone doesn't mean much. It's a weakness because it's a reaction that would only make a bad situation worse, or a neutral or good situation bad.

Thinking about empathy in the same way shows that it's neither a weakness nor irrational. If a kitten displays behaviours which clearly demonstrate that it's experiencing pain, it's rational to respond as if it is in fact in pain. For example, if you hurt the kitten it will attack you or run away. If you persist it will grow more aggressive or fearful, or both. It's not a weakness to respond empathetically because that will end the pain, improving the situation for you and the kitten (i.e., it's an adaptive response). It's not irrational since the point of empathy is, by sharing the kitten's experience, to get you to do what's best for the kitten. The purpose of feeling empathy would have to be something different for such a response to be considered irrational. It's how *kittens themselves* learn not to hurt each other (whether or not you'd call that empathy is another debate).

The difference, aside from the lack a nervous system, is that computers are not programmed to learn that a particular signal (i.e., the experience of pain) indicates that whatever action they performed should be avoided. Of course, as you know, they can be programmed that way. But in general they're not. They are simply programmed to avoid performing the action in the first place (or rather, not programmed to perform the action, thus obviating a need for avoidance). Alternatively, they are programmed to alert someone to their need of attention/repair, and to shut down or otherwise continue performing whatever functions are still available. Such programming is direct, specific, and limited; very different from the processes involved in experiencing and learning from pain.

However, suppose a robot were programmed to learn from its interactions with the environment. Suppose further that it was most effective to program it to learn to generate a strong signal (i.e., pain) in response to damage (whether or not it caused the damage itself), and a similar signal would also be generated to override any action which previously caused it damage. If it is damaged, it cringes, retreats, and lets out a piercing sound, all to let anything nearby know that it has been damaged, and that whatever caused it shouldn't be repeated (even if whatever caused the damage was non-sentient). Generating the "pain" signal floods the robot with energy, preparing it for rapid action. However that energy can't be reclaimed, so if it's not used, it's lost. The robot releases particular fluids which also help it respond quickly and vigourously if necessary, however those fluids are damaging if they're allowed to build up. In such an unlikely scenario it would be rational to feel empathy for a robot. And in fact we probably would. There is plenty of evidence that people respond to robots as they do to humans, if the robots behave sufficiently like humans. But as far as I'm aware, no computers or robots or machines are programmed that way (and there is ample reason to think that would be *far* from the most effective implementation of damage avoidance), so it's not irrational to lack empathy for computers, but it is irrational to approximate computer programming or machine functions to the experience of animals, at least until their implementation goes beyond logical equivalence and attains fully-functional equivalence.

<p>Try not to be distracted by scientific evidence, per se, on differentiation within a given person's mind; consider instead the function and the how of empathy.</p>

<p>In terms of comparative irrationality, believing in [god] and experiencing or being motivated by empathy are both reliant on the defensive and developmental mechanism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_identification" rel="nofollow">(Projective) Identification</a>. In terms of the second concept you are addressing, psychopathy (lack of empathy) toward computers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy#Perspective-taking" rel="nofollow">you might refer to the</a> "discussions have distinguished between empathy (as the more intuitive emotional aspect) and perspective-taking (as the more cognitive aspect)." Empathy is an important mechanism in that it promotes/provides for community and the long term success of the species (as it is currently manifest); perspective-taking is important in that allows us to view the world and the objects in it objectively and as means to a specific end.</p>

<p>Irrationality is an odd metric to introduce in comparing the three of these types of entities. The degree to which a given person identifies with [god] (supernatural, generally anthropomorphic), kittens (natural, anthropomorphic), and computer hardware (natural/synthetic, not anthropomorphic) might give you a better construct for evaluating how someone comes to empathize with one, as opposed to another, of those entities.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you are considering why a given person might detest pain toward a kitten more than a computer it is likely because the person can project their understanding of pain (by experiencing it) on to the kitten, whereas they may not have enough of an identification with a laptop to do the same. In this way, although empathy might not be a cognitive (rational) motivator, it can be rationalized functionally.</p></li>
<li><p>To add a moral question on top, just extend the degree of identification with a dose of value-judgment. The degree of value-judgment required (by the act in consideration; i.e. torture by morality has a higher degree of judgment than gossiping about) will have a multiplicative relation to the degree of identification with the subject (i.e. a person might be 10/10, a dog a 9/10, an ant a 4/10, a computer a 2/10). In this way, you can create a metric for how a given person reacts and understand what motivates their rational layer of thought. In a sense, value-judgment is the synergy between empathy and value-judgment.</p></li>

<i>Rationally, we can acknowledge that the kitten's brain is essentially a computer, that pain is not supernatural, and that there is no technical reason the kitten's sensation of pain is fundamentally different than whatever happens in a robot or other man-made machine when it is forced into a situation that it is programmed to attempt to avoid.</i>

Ergo it should be rationally fine to torture animals, that seems to be your conclusion.  Of course, if it's OK to torture kittens then by only one small step of induction it should be fine to torture humans as well, since they're ultimately nothing but biological machines as well.

Did you ever consider that perhaps the more reasonable conclusion would be that it's just as wrong to torture robots?

Of course, we both know that in the current age the comparison is absolutely ridiculous.  The amount of work that has to be done in order to translate a simple avoidance algorithm into the kind of complex integration with other components that can comprise a form of consciousness is quite large.  Teasing an avoidance algorithm is more like teasing an amoeba, not a kitten.  Thus the conclusion one naturally comes to when making this categorical error is to err on the side of, "everything's just a basic machine," while if we really had machines that where anything like kittens in the world the picture we would have in our minds would be quite, quite different.

Might I suggest you go get yourself a copy of <u>The Mind's I</u> and have a read of the chapter titled "Soul of the Mark III Beast"?  Or you can just read it online: http://junkerhq.net/MGS2/MarkIII.html

<p>Taking a cold and clinical viewpoint of pain and empathy, I think it's fair to claim that empathy is a <em>weakness</em>, but I don't think you can defend the claim that it is <em>irrational</em>.  Empathy plays a significant part in a species' ability to live long enough to procreate and produce subsequent generations of itself.  For instance, a lion feels no empathy towards a gazelle when the lion needs to eat, but the lion makes sure that its cubs and other members of its pride have a chance at the dead gazelle to fulfill their need for sustenance.  For humans, it <em>could</em> be foolish to show empathy to an enemy during war time because that enemy <em>could</em> kill you when you're not looking.  However, it <em>could</em> be beneficial to show empathy towards an enemy if there is some chance that the empathic behavior would be returned--consider the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androcles" rel="nofollow">Androcles and the Lion</a>.</p>

<p>We are not born with empathy, it is something we learn through interaction with other things, humans, other animals, vegetation, etc.  I encountered a theory some time ago, but I don't currently remember exactly where, that during development children need to be exposed to the nurturing, caring behavior that is stereotypic to mothers as well as the more combatant play that is stereotypic of fathers.  For proper development, children have to have someone who plays with limited roughness so that they learn about limits--children learn that being pinned by an older sibling makes them feel bad, so they learn not to  do the same thing to others.  <strong><em>This</strong> is the meaning of empathy</em>.</p>

<p>Empathy may be considered a weakness, but in light of what it means to the propagation of a species, it is definitely not irrational.</p>

All kinds of animals other than humans show empathy, both to members of their own species and across species boundaries. It's all through the primatology literature, and of course there are countless recent news stories of things like dolphins saving human swimmers from sharks.

Personally, I've seen both our late pet lovebird (with a brain the size of a peanut) and our cat be very empathetic when my wife or I have been ill or emotionally upset, coming over and cuddling up to us in ways they don't when we're not in such a state. It certainly comes across as an attempt at comfort.

Also, if you watch nature documentaries, you see empathy all the time in them. Herd animals often exhibit empathy: a lioness brings down a wildebeest calf, and then quietly leaves after finding herself surrounded by two dozen very angry-looking mature male wildebeest who certainly aren't all the calf's father, after which the calf gets up and calmly resumes munching grass.

You can also see empathy in human children far too young to have been taught anything. For instance, if you get a bunch of little kids in a room, if one of them starts crying, pretty soon they'll all be crying. Ask anybody who works in day care.

So rather than being something human children must be taught, empathy is clearly an innate response, and thus has a genetic basis. If it's not a case of convergent evolution, empathy would then have to go back at least to the common ancestor of synapsids (of which mammals are the main living example) and sauropsids (which include birds), which would be about 324 million years ago, during the late Carboniferous.

For the genes that trigger an empathetic response to have not only survived for so long, but be present in such a huge range of successful species, they must provide an immense boost to survival and reproduction. Whether or not you can reconcile yourself with it philosophically, from the standpoint of evolutionary biology, empathy is clearly an out-of-the-park grand slam for species success.

When we don't have any food to eat and we are desperately hungry ( rationally speaking )  eating a plate full of shit should satisfy our hunger.  Ethics emerges from nature. If we have a natural disgust to needless suffering of the weak and powerless, this must be integral to any system of ethics/morality that wants my subscription.

I have 2 problems with the question. 

No. 1 is: How rationality, evolution, god and religion are easily intermixed to generate a cocktail of confusion. 

The introduction is, that we, the humans as we are, are capable of theism, and capable of empathy, and both have evolved and therefore proven to be good for us. In that they are similar. 

Well - they are, and they are not. 

The problem in the argumentation is, that the possibility of theism isn't theism, and while we are capable of theism, we are capable of atheism, and of reasoning, and reflecting other people being theists. This doesn't mean much for the truth of religious claims, or the usefulness of theism today and tomorrow. A capacity might be useful in one sense, and not that useful in another sense, and the settings might change. Strong people have the ability to fight against wild and dangerous animals, but might do harm to other people. The one thing we appreciate, the other thing not that much. 

If we want to judge about empathy, we have to look at it closely - not just from a very general perspective, that it did evolve together with us. Else, if we were Brontosaurus Rex, we would believe everything is okay as well, as long as we exist. Empathy is useful in learning: We see someone else getting hit by a cat, and know how he is suffering, and try to avoid his behavior. On the other side, we might take too much risks in trying to help somebody, and getting ourselves in trouble. There isn't a simple, digital answer to 'is empathy good?'. 

If I read 'irrational' as emotionless as I can, I can of course argue, that we, the humans, act emphatic *before* reasoning about it, that even animals act emphatic, and that they don't know why too. That is right, but surely not something a religious person likes to hear, to excuse his religious, unreflected behaving. 

No. 2: You can't be cruel to a machine. It has no self-awareness, no nerves, and no interest to survive. It's dead like a stone. And a kittens brain isn't a computer. A computer-speaker, telling you "I'm suffering like a kitten" is lying. Not even that - to lie, it would need to have awareness too. 

Empathy is based on the fact of similarity, so if you see a suffering kitten, you know how it feels, at least you have an idea how it feels. But there is no way to feel like a laptop without power or an overheated one. For a social being, it is helpful to learn from each other, and if we help each other, we might survive problems which a single person wouldn't solve. 

But empathy, being shown as useful, doesn't mean it is always useful. The same as being big, strong, fast or a good swimmer isn't always useful.

Empathy is perfectly rational because it increases chances of group and species survival and humans are not isolated individuals but always members of one or more groups starting with the family and going all the way up to nations and the homo sapiens sapiens species itself.
