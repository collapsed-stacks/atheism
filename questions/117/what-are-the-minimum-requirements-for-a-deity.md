What properties would an entity need to have to be considered a deity?

For example, the universe could have been created by super-intelligent aliens, who evolved naturally. Would they be considered to be gods (because they were the "creators")?

Or does god by definition have to be *supernatural*? If so, which supernatural properties must it have?

In other words, what exactly do atheists lack belief in?
