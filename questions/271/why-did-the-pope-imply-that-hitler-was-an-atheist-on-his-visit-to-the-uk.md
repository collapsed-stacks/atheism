Hitler is recorded in history saying "I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so" [Adolph Hitler, to Gen. Gerhard Engel, 1941] and "I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator. By warding off the Jews I am fighting for the Lord's work."[Adolph Hitler, Speech, Reichstag, 1936].

During his visit to the UK the Pope said Hitler was an Atheist. Hitler was never excommunicated from the Catholic Church. Why would he say this?

Even in our own lifetime, we can recall how Britain and her leaders stood against a Nazi tyranny that wished to eradicate God from society and denied our common humanity to many, especially the Jews, who were thought unfit to live. I also recall the regime’s attitude to Christian pastors and religious who spoke the truth in love, opposed the Nazis and paid for that opposition with their lives. As we reflect on the sobering lessons of the atheist extremism of the twentieth century, let us never forget how the exclusion of God, religion and virtue from public life leads ultimately to a truncated vision of man and of society and thus to a “reductive vision of the person and his destiny” (Caritas in Veritate, 29).
