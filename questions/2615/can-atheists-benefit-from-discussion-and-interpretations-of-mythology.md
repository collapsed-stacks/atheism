Many people read the the Iliad and the Odyssey and other mythological texts and don't believe that any of the events occurred or creatures and beings ever existed, however they claim to get something from the reading. I don't believe a train can think or have perseverance, but when I was a kid, I got some value from "The Little Engine That Could". Robert Bly made a good living, and started an entire movement by interpreting a Grimm's fairy tale in his book, "Iron John". 

I understand that we also need to address where to draw the line, but that is a different question. First, I want to ask if it fits within the definition of atheism to acknowledge that myths have value, that studying, reading, discussing and learning from them is an important part of any education? 

EDIT: an attempt at a definition: A story or preferably a set of stories with similar settings and characters with recognizable physical elements for a society that also include characters that have thoughts but don't have conscience brains, such as dead people speaking, the wind having purpose, a trickster animal or something with no form at all. These characters could be good, evil, masters of other's fate or not. Also included could be characters with physical abilities beyond any known natural limits.

Excluded for my definition for this question would be claims of someone thinking or doing something, such as "It's a myth that Einstein believed in the Christian god." and allegory in a story, like "the wind was furious."
