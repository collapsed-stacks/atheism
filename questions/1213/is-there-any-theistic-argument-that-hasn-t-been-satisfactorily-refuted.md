So, there are theists who dedicate their lives to study and defend their faith, and many of these have proposed some tough challenges/arguments for atheists. Do you know of any such argument that has not seen a 'satisfactory' rebuttal (according to you, or whoever else you respect)?

__note__: I'm aware that a lot of arguments, though appealing, could be based on shaky foundations. I also know that people (as someone here mentioned) sometimes perform mental gymnastics. Don't let these weaknesses stop you, but if you are aware of them, please mention what they are. Point out other weaknesses as well on your answer.
