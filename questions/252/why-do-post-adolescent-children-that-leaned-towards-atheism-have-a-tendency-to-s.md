It makes sense that as children learn about the world their need for a god-of-the-gaps diminishes, and occasionally leaves them entirely depending on their upbringing.  Teenage rebelliousness may also play a factor I suppose.

However, why is it that during college and later in life, many people seem to swing wildly back becoming evangelized?
