I speak specifically about some religions view regarding cleanliness and food handling, such as Kosher and Halal laws. I can imagine why both belief systems don't eat pork, at the time of their inceptions there was probably a real physical risk to eating pork, i.e. trichinosis, E. coli, etc. I also understand why in some underdeveloped areas it still has relevance.

The question I pose is why are these rule systems relevant in the areas that don't have these risks? (US, Most of Europe, etc). Is this something that our society will reject as scientific discovery exposes these risks, and finds a way to deal with them? Or will they remain as vestigial cultural practices (Christian male circumcision)?
