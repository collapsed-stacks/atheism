Since atheists are most likely to have a science-based outlook on life, when it comes to their hour of death shouldn't atheists consider giving their body to science? There's that old joke about the funeral of an atheist, "All dressed up with nowhere to go." Now we can say that when we die we go to medical school. Such a more worthy "afterlife"- us helping the advancement of science.
