As has been discussed here recently, belief in God is a successful strategy for feeling a bigger sense of importance and purpose in life. God created us as part of a bigger plan; we are all infused with God's spirit; there is an absolute right and wrong; I am going to heaven; etc etc. As someone stated, a person with these beliefs is trading in their intellectual honesty in exchange for comfort and a perceived purpose to their lives.

* Atheism is supposedly a break from that self-deception. We value intellectual honesty above a false sense of purpose. But is that contradicted by upholding morality? By disallowing one specific higher purpose, some Godly righteousness, are we deceiving ourselves when we attempt to perpetuate some other sense of purpose?

A theist would argue you can only be moral if you believe in God (as morality is handed down from above). As atheists, we are quick to reject this notion and assert morality really comes from social norms and religion has merely adopted the same values, not dictated them. What remains is the implied and tacit agreement that we should be moral.

* If we reject heaven's higher purpose, why should we not reject the compulsion that we should be moral?

To me, if you want to be intellectually honest all the way down, you have to recognize that there is really and truly no higher purpose to anything. Therefore, there is no such thing as "should". Otherwise, it seems that even atheists are still stuck in the pattern of trying to find significance and purpose where there is none.

Even when saying it is to be more "productive", haven't we still just shed one layer of intellectual dishonesty (that our purpose comes from God) while clinging to another layer (that we still have a purpose)?

* Is being a good citizen and friend, and creating an environment that is better for yourself inherently valuable to justify spending one's limited time and energy (by adhering to social norms, trying to be "good", etc)?

Aversion to discomfort is a survival mechanism; this aversion generates my reactions of 'good' and 'bad'. It's just my brain trying to induce me to avoid a situation that reduces my ability to spread my genes, because that's what the mind evolved to do. The only reason I try to spread my genes is that I, as an organism, have evolved to try to spread my genes, nothing more.

* Is a better life really just the sum of pursuing this survival mechanism? How does that stack up against the neglibility of humankind's impact on scale with the Universe?

* Atheism is supposedly a break from that self-deception. We value intellectual honesty above a false sense of purpose. But is that contradicted by upholding morality? By disallowing one specific higher purpose, some Godly righteousness, are we deceiving ourselves when we attempt to perpetuate some other sense of purpose?

A theist would argue you can only be moral if you believe in God (as morality is handed down from above). As atheists, we are quick to reject this notion and assert morality really comes from social norms and religion has merely adopted the same values, not dictated them. What remains is the implied and tacit agreement that we should be moral.

* If we reject heaven's higher purpose, why should we not reject the compulsion that we should be moral?

To me, if you want to be intellectually honest all the way down, you have to recognize that there is really and truly no higher purpose to anything. Therefore, there is no such thing as "should". Otherwise, it seems that even atheists are still stuck in the pattern of trying to find significance and purpose where there is none.

Even when saying it is to be more "productive", haven't we still just shed one layer of intellectual dishonesty (that our purpose comes from God) while clinging to another layer (that we still have a purpose)?

* Is being a good citizen and friend, and creating an environment that is better for yourself inherently valuable to justify spending one's limited time and energy (by adhering to social norms, trying to be "good", etc)?

Aversion to discomfort is a survival mechanism; this aversion generates my reactions of 'good' and 'bad'. It's just my brain trying to induce me to avoid a situation that reduces my ability to spread my genes, because that's what the mind evolved to do. The only reason I try to spread my genes is that I, as an organism, have evolved to try to spread my genes, nothing more.

* Is a better life really just the sum of pursuing this survival mechanism? How does that stack up against the neglibility of humankind's impact on scale with the Universe?

As has been discussed here recently, belief in God is a successful strategy for feeling a bigger sense of importance and purpose in life. God created us as part of a bigger plan; we are all infused with God's spirit; there is an absolute right and wrong; I am going to heaven; etc etc. As someone stated, a person with these beliefs is trading in their intellectual honesty in exchange for comfort and a perceived purpose to their lives.
