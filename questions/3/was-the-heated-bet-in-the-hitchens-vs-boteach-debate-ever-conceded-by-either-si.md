I just [watched this debate, from 2008, between Hitchens vs.Boteach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnMYL8sF7bQ&NR=1). In this debate, Boteach comes off like a Jewish Bill O'Reilly; but, they both agree on this non-trivial bet (originally proposed by Boteach) whereby the loser had to buy 100 books from the winner and distribute them to the loser's colleges. The bet was over some ruling in an Isreal rabbinical court: I'm not sure of the background of the referenced case -- feel free to clear it up.

At 1:03 Boteach reads a statement from Hitchen's book:

> "Speaking about [Baruch Goldstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein), Christopher Hitchens writes while serving as a physician in the Israeli Army he had announced that he would not treat non-Jewish patients such as Isreali Arabs on the sabbath as it happens he was obeying Rabbinic law and declining not to do this, as many Israeli courts had confirmed." - Boteach

Going on, he says

> "I challenge Mr. Hitchens to name a single Jewish court in the entire world that would ever rule that a non-Jew should not be treated on the Sabbath. In fact, if he names it I will buy a 100 copies of his book and I will give it to [...] my religious friends; but, if he fails I challenge him to buy 100 copies of my book." - Boteach

At about 1:06 Boteach makes a statement to counter one of Hitchens's statements that I presume comes from his book:

> "That it is a slander to say, against Jews, that any Jewish court would say that non Jews should not be treated, and the state of Israel treats every single Arab and Palestinian even when terrorists are brought to hospitals." - Boteach

The exchange gets quite directed at around 1:10, and the civility degrades until the conclusion of the pissing contest. At around 1:14 we find Boteach summarizing the bet:

> "I just wanna repeat that we heard tonight that a high rabbinical court said you could not save a non-Jewish life on the sabbath, that is absolutely false."  - Boteach

Hitchen's apparently affirming he accepts this chants in the background *"100 books riding on this."*  You again hear both of them chanting in agreement "100 books" in the last 5 seconds of the debate.

Now, it seems [Wikipedia indicates Hitchens won](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Shahak#Alleged_telephone_incident). Did he? Did Boteach buy those 100 books and distribute them to Jewish colleagues?

Anyone have a line to Hitchens? Did he ever hold Boteach to his gambit?
