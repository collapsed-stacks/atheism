Is there a resource which might help atheists find like-minded groups or meetings in their area?

I am in Brazil and I am looking for like-minded people.

<p>I've found groups in my local area on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetup.com/</a>.  Not sure if it extends to Germany but take a look and see.  </p>

Ask the <a href="http://www.the-brights.net/">Brights</a>. The "Community" area on the web site contains some interesting links and references. In particular, there is an email contact <a href="http://www.the-brights.net/community/blc/list.html">here</a> for the Brazilian Brights Community Cluster.
