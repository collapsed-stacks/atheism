I personally find it hard to understand how a person can go into the army or navy with the understanding that they may be required to kill not only the enemy but also on occasion innocent civilians.

As an Atheist I could imagine someone thinking it was okay to kill because there was no one watching, this could lead to terrible actions but then I could imagine they might have more compassion. I could also see the same happening for a religious person. 

So, Do Atheists make better or worse soldiers? Would they be more moral and would that work for a modern army?
