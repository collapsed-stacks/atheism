Claims of experiencing [X] frequently litter stories of people who convert from one religion to another, refresh their faith, or otherwise come to accept some new (to them) theistic notions. In these scenarios, [X] can range from things specific like 'I felt the Holy Spirit come into me' to 'I had an experience where suddenly I escaped the trappings of my individuated self, and took on a cosmological state of mind.' They can also be more generalized experiences of non-ordinary consciousness, feelings of spontaneous well-being, or epiphany-type episodes (i.e. in a case where some bit of gnosis is mystically understood). How does an atheist approach the following:

 - While the dubiousness and veracity of these claims can be held to scrutiny, I am not asking that question. I would like to know, based on exposure to the spectrum of these kinds of accounts, what categorization method is coherent within atheism to encapsulate this spectrum in order to classify it and explain it to the person who underwent the experience. 

 - Although these experiences are generally held in a religious context, they are quantifiable episodes that correlate with actual stimuli and the person's organism and play into the psychology/pathos of a person. As such, I am interested in a secular, non-god approach to explaining where the grandiose sense of meaning comes from in these circumstances. It can borrow theistic archetypes, as they are embedded in our consiousness, but must remain atheistically coherent. (i.e. Where an atheist may disdain 'mysticism' generally, is pursuit of those experiences without value?)

This may sound like a question about these experiences, but essentially I am looking for a very sober approach to deconstructing non-ordinary states of consciousness and mystic experiences.
