Which real religions (not parodies) do not have specific negative effects (beyond encouraging belief in things without rational evidence to do so), if any? For example, does Buddhism have specific negative effects? 

Please be specific; making broad generalizations about religion in general, i.e. "All religions require [bad thing] or inspire [other bad thing]," is not as helpful as being specific about something that doesn't rely on a debatable correlation.
