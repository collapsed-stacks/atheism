## In Texas, would it be "religious discrimination" to state that your organization is "atheist", or to make company statements about superstitions?

I just passed my Texas Real Estate exams today (did it on the first time). I'm wanting to know to what extent is it legal to "come out" as a non-Christian company in a regulated industry that would prohibit religious discrimination.

Is there a court case that states how anti-theist you can be, before you're religiously discriminating? Is advertising that you're an Atheist? Or, moreover that you're a non-Christian, non-Muslim, non-theist organization discriminating? Can you make a statement about superstition regardless of religion, and not be discriminating? Any precedents on this matter would greatly be appreciated.
