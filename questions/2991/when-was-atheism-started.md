<p>The term itself originates (perhaps even re-originates) in the 16th century, though what we would recognize modern 'positive' atheism doesn't properly emerge until the 18th century. </p>

<p>Note that the basic position of not-believing-in-theism is almost certainly as old as the position of theism itself. </p>

<p>(You may wish to look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_atheism" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's article on the history of atheism</a>.)</p>

Sometime back in the primordial soup... It probably took a while for a creature to evolve enough imagination to start ascribing natural phenomena to some kind of supernatural being.

But, if you mean consciously - then probably just as long as theism has been around ("I don't believe that the Lord Ug causes fire").

As a concept, it has to go back at least to Biblical times, since Psalm 14:1 says, in part, "The fool hath said in his heart, '[there is] no god.'"  (KJV translation).
