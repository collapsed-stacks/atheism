I have been struggling with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Goedel's incompleteness theorem</a> (the first one), specifically with implications it seems to have. In the realm of mathematic theorems that have been extensively studied, there is not much doubt about the validity of the proof itself. The doubtful part is what its implications are and how (or if) it relates to our life.

 - Simply put, Goedel's theorem states that if a mathematical theory is sufficiently complex (contains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano's arithmetic</a>, so you can count using integers), there are true statements that cannot be proven within the theory.

Here is where this becomes interesting. Since you can count, you could argue that your internal theory about the world contains Peano's arithmetic. As a consequence (providing your theory of the world is consistent), you can never prove every single truth, even if given infinite means.

There have been arguments that this idea is flawed, since people make mistakes and their theories about the world are thus inconsistent.

Which means that either you are consistent and do not make mistakes and you will never know every truth (replace "you" with "humankind past, present and future", same thing for these purposes), or you make mistakes and are inconsistent and thus you actually might know every truth, but sadly, thanks to inconsistency, you would also know every falsehood - it would logically be all the same to you.

It can be argued that embracing Goedel's theorem leads to eastern philosophies that appear to reject consistency (a statement can be both true and false at the same time), and in exchange provide the potentail to gain the ultimate knowledge (which at the same time happens to be a complete lack of knowledge).

This is also seems to be reflected in Christianity, where you are told that you should abandon your logic and replace it with belief. It makes sense - logic can only get you so far.

I find it very hard to root for logic, as the logic contains within itself means of its own undoing. Thinking logically means being eternally limited with no means of escaping that jail. The only way out means to abandon logic. It seems that if we used strict logic for ruling our everyday affairs, thinking everything to its ultimate consequences, we would have to behave like pure lunatics (our theories are necessarily inconsistent, single inconsistency spoils the entire theory, making every statement both true and false at the same time, you cannot really make decisions if everything is true and false at once!). It is a great thing we do not behave logically! And apparently, religions have a grain of deep mathematical truth in them.

My main question is - what is the main flaw with the train of thought I proposed?
