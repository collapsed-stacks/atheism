I was reading [this question][1] and the instructions at the end told me that if I was unclear about the meaning of any word, I could assume that it was either the first or second meaning in Merriam-Webster.

Well, I got to the word *fundagelical*, went over to m-w.com, and was left very unsatisfied, as there was neither a first nor a second definition for this word.

Can you help define this word for me?  Thanks!
