A few recent questions have been seen about the positive or negative impacts of religion. Some ask in a present state, some imply throughout history. My question is not specific to any particular impact, or what the impact is. 

However, as atheists (more likely- as pattern-observing humans in general), we have a tendency to make claims about the impact of religion upon history. If we are going to make these claims it is worth asking:

 1. How do you go about assesing that impact and correlating action A with consequence B? 
 2. Critically speaking, what method of analysis do you  implement to evaluate and put forward claims of this nature?


----------


Some things to consider; religious wars always include a political aspect, religion has been a part of every society so how do separate its impact, claims of religion by leaders are not always authentic. There are obvious inherent problems in this question. For example, the lack of a control group. It is not possible to isolate a population large enough to be a valid non-religious group. 

 - However, if I asked “What is America’s impact on the world, or what is Haliburton’s impact”, you would have a similar problem, but I think you could come up with a method. Simple methods include counting deaths or counting the cost of maintaining big worthless buildings and fancy costumes. These have pitfalls, as this attempt at demonstrating how statistics lie shows. http://necrometrics.com/gunsorxp.htm

Although broad, I think the question is worth consideration to help focus other discussions. Without some sort of methodology, it is over-simple to let any discussion to devolve into “all religion is bad”. There is a persistent idea that all religion should be eradicated. Besides being crass and ignoring history and culture, this clouds any real discussion of how atheists should approach the real world or how we might prioritize the goals of a movement.
