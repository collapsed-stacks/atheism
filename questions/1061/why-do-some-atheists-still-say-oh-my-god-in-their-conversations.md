There are nonbelievers that I know personally, and others who are celebrities, who use the OMG phrase in conversation - and sometimes even in debate. I realize it's a sort of knee-jerk response but shouldn't nonbelievers, especially those of us who want religion to fade away, rid their vocabulary of these types of exclamations? (Yes, even during sex.)

Even cussing, using phrases such as "god damn" and "Jesus!" I've heard uttered by atheists, makes me shake my head. The less of god and Jesus heard in the world, the less important those words become.
