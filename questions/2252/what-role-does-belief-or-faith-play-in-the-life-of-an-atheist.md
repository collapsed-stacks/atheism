On another thread, a responder said, "I don't think 'belief' is an everyday term for an atheist."  

I contend that in fact, atheists have beliefs and act on "faith" regularly.  

So this question is clearly a semantic/philosophical one, turning on how you use "belief."  Do atheists need a special definition of "belief?"  Is all "faith" the same?

The common definition of "faith" is something along the lines of "believing something without evidence.   I would like to modify this for the sake of this question, and say

**"Faith is a willingness to act on a belief, without any guarantees that your actions will achieve your desired ends."**

In that case, I think atheists hold beliefs and act on faith all the time.  We're just willing to reassess or change our beliefs if results demand it, and we don't hold faith as a virtue, but as a necessary evil of having to take action at all times with less than perfect information.
