There are a lot of people who I suspect are not atheists simply because they don't like the idea of dying and then never existing again. I remember that when I was investigating religion and atheism, I at first didn't want to be an atheist for the same reason. Even after I reluctantly accepted that yes, its a lot more likely that a god doesn't exist, there was a small period where I was in a sort of depression. I got over it fairly quickly though, and now I'm happy that there isn't any god and only us are in control of our destinies.

How do other atheists deal with mortality and death, and how can theists - who take comfort in the idea of an afterlife, be helped to accept the reality even though it might be what they don't want to hear at first?
