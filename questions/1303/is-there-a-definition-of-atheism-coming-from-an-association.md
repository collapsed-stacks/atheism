Are there any atheist associations that have adopted a definition of the word?  Ideally, I would like something that came from a international organization. 

I know the dictionary definition.  The question is about what an atheist or non-believer association uses and not about the the dictionary definition.  I am also interested in resolution in from association adopting a given definition.
