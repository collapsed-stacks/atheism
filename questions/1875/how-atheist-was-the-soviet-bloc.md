My understanding is that Marxist theory was strictly anti-religion. We all know the quote about "opiate of the people" and all that. 

But my understanding is also that the totalitarian states of the Soviet bloc (in any case arguably not properly Marxist at all) soon learnt there was little to be gained in persecuting the religious and found it useful to allow it **so long as local churches didn't offer a challenge to the state or harbour serious dissidents**. 

Is this fair enough?
