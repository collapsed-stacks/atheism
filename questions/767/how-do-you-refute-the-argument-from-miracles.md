Sometimes, while debating Christians, I encounter arguments of the following form:

 - I had a terrible disease.
 - The doctors said the disease cannot be cured.
 - I prayed to God and I was cured.
 - Therefore, God exists.
 - (And the doctors say it must have been a miracle)

Answers should be in a form that would challenge religious people, rather than get applause from skeptics.
