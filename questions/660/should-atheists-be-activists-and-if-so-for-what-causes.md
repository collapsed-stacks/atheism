**[edited question]**

I often hear it said that getting Atheists to join anything, or do anything together is like herding cats.  I agree that there is something about atheists that makes them less inclined to "need" groups, but our unwillingness to band together as a group makes us a politically ineffective constituency, easily ignored.  I think there are common interests that atheist "ought" to be activist for... but what do YOU think?

Put another way, is it true that the only thing atheists have in common is a lack of belief in God?  

Common Interests (from answers):<br>
1. Fight to maintain/increase Church State Separation.  Government neutrality toward belief.<br>
2. Fight against blasphemy laws and/or prosecutions. (Essentially, freedom of expression and opinion).<br>
3. Fight for improved, (or mandatory?) critical thinking curriculum including scientific method based education.<br>

A common belief unites people, and that's what gives organised religions their strength. Since atheists don't share a belief, they are not united by anything. We would need an extra effort to join forces.

You ask whether atheists *should* unite. Well, I think so. But it would be especially difficult, for the reason I just explained.

Yes, they only thing Atheists have in common is their lack of belief in a god.

Many atheists aren't even concerned about religious practices, they keep to themselves. Setting up a political party based on atheism would be an impossibility, there would be no consensus on financial or social policy.

Atheists are best served by lobby groups. Keeping the church out of government should be the first role. Secondary would be ensuring proper, science based education where applicable.

Only if you feel passionate about the cause. 

I have no problem with, and generally celebrate, atheist activists, however feel that it is someone else's viewpoint, a viewpoint that I have rejected, that I must suddenly get involved with to be an active atheist.

In other words, I feel no compunction to be driven by someone else's agenda, even if it is to act as the antithesis (and antitheist :) ) of that agenda. 

I will, and do, get involved when I see it in some way affecting my life, or the life of my family, but who am I to expend my energy fighting someone's belief system when it has a neutral affect on me, and possibly a positive psychological benefit to them. Living in a country that is not (yet at least) being run by  a religious agenda, this is, I admit, perhaps a luxury.

Are we not uniting here?  But to answer your question, yes. I dont like the term herding cats, it may have a basis in truth but why not leave out the negative and point out the positive.
