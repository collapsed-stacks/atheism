**[edited question]**

I often hear it said that getting Atheists to join anything, or do anything together is like herding cats.  I agree that there is something about atheists that makes them less inclined to "need" groups, but our unwillingness to band together as a group makes us a politically ineffective constituency, easily ignored.  I think there are common interests that atheist "ought" to be activist for... but what do YOU think?

Put another way, is it true that the only thing atheists have in common is a lack of belief in God?  

Common Interests (from answers):<br>
1. Fight to maintain/increase Church State Separation.  Government neutrality toward belief.<br>
2. Fight against blasphemy laws and/or prosecutions. (Essentially, freedom of expression and opinion).<br>
3. Fight for improved, (or mandatory?) critical thinking curriculum including scientific method based education.<br>
