What are the questions that would be most beneficial to the atheist community to have the answer?

This is not meant to suggest that science should try to find answers that atheists would like, but rather to find the questions that matter to the atheist community.

For example: <br>Some might say developing a deeper understanding of what makes supernatural belief so pervasive?
<br> Others might want to know more deeply how persuasion works and why some people seem relatively inert when presented with evidence that contradicts their beleifs.

This is a reposting of a previous question which was shut down due to its seeming like a poll. This is more what the spirit of the question was trying to achieve, and I appreciate both those who criticized the previous phrasing for encouraging me to clarify myself and the supporters who I think understood what I was trying to get at.
