I have read arguments (will try to find source for citation) that free will is essentially incompatible with the "all-knowing" part of an almighty being. It boils down to: if a (wo)man is free to choose what to do [in whatever situation], then by definition, god does not know what (s)he will choose to do and that makes the deity _not_ almighty. On the other hand, if the deity does have that knowledge then it isn't really that much of a _free_ will. I find that argument really compelling. Anyone hear of any _logical_ refutations?
