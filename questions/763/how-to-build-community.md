The only positive I can see that comes from organized religion is the sense of community that members feel. I believe that this is also the motivation behind Unitarian Universalism which is essentially the Christian ritual but with a "smorgasbord" approach to the actual theology: members, it seems, are able to pick and choose from whatever belief systems work for them. This approach doesn't work for me (I reject the ritual along with the beliefs) but it does seem to fill a gap that is commonly felt by humans.

What are effective ways of building a sense of community both between nonbelievers and nonbelievers and nonbelievers and the rest of society?
