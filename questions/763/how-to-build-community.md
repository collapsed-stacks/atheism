The only positive I can see that comes from organized religion is the sense of community that members feel. I believe that this is also the motivation behind Unitarian Universalism which is essentially the Christian ritual but with a "smorgasbord" approach to the actual theology: members, it seems, are able to pick and choose from whatever belief systems work for them. This approach doesn't work for me (I reject the ritual along with the beliefs) but it does seem to fill a gap that is commonly felt by humans.

What are effective ways of building a sense of community both between nonbelievers and nonbelievers and nonbelievers and the rest of society?

As an atheist, I'm forced to admit there are tangible benefits to being religious. Respectable studies show that people who go to church are happier, live longer, etc. These are benefits of communality, of course, and not of religion. Something to keep in mind, though!

I used to be skeptical/critical of the UU because of their lukewarm religiosity, rooted as Richard says in Christianity. However, upon a closer look, I consider the UU churches an almost ideal "exit" strategy for Americans dropping out of their faith:

* Atheists are accepted by the UU, and not forced into any worship or rituals they would disapprove of;
* As members of an UU church, they have at least *some* answer to the ever-popular neighborly question, "where do you go to church?" Not all Americans are blessed (hehe!) to live in Massachusetts, Vermont or California; there are places where you're not considered a decent human being if you don't go to church. A similar consideration applies to young atheists who could use the UU as an "alibi church" toward their parents or other relatives.
* In a UU church, atheists can enjoy the social life and its many attendant benefits without having to suffer religion as such, especially the hateful Christian death cult.

In the long term, as atheism becomes more socially acceptable, I hope to see either

* the UU churches becoming more atheist, or
* new atheist "churches," i.e. "community centers" or whatever popping up.

Community is having common interests and goals. 

As a homogeneous community of disbelievers, we're dispersed and we have no local bonds outside of being atheist or living in a community. Many places have atheist meetup groups, and you can always start your own.

For bridging the gap between believers and disbelievers, we just have to be active and involved in or volunteering in our local communities despite religious differences. Being a good and helpful neighbor is also important. We have to highlight what makes us the same: respect for our neighbors and neighborhoods, love of family and friends and having other people's best interests in mind.
