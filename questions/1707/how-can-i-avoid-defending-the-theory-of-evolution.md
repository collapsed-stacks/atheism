As a layman I simply do not have the knowledge to explain the theory of evolution. I accept the basic idea of course, but what I know about the subject could be written in about three paragraphs - and I don't understand any of the technical terms. Ask me a tricky question about DNA or RNA, and all I can give you is a blank stare.

It is up to the theist to prove that god exists, but many theists try to avoid that responsibility by asking the atheist to explain the theory of evolution. Then, if the atheist fails, the theist will declare victory by default: "You can't explain how life evolved, therefore god must have created it." It's a silly argument, but I haven't figured a way around it.

At the moment I just admit my ignorance, and explain that the tactic used by the theist is not designed to find the truth about evolution, but to avoid the task of proving god's existence. I point out that it is not an either/or situation; that my inability to explain evolution does not "prove" god, but usually I am the only one convinced - and the theist never feels obligated to provide evidence for a deity.

Is there another way to make the theist feel obligated to provide that evidence?
