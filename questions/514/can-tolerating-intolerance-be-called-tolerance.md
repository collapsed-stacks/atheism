Many religious beliefs can be practised or observed as intolerant. Part of this relies on religious systems are often exclusivist of non-believers (intolerance), then try to persuade others to join their faith (more intolerance). Also, there is a tendencyto judge others for things they deem "sinful" (again, more intolerance).

At the same time, it is politically correct to be tolerant, and most societies see it appropriate to be tolerant with different religious beliefs even though you are an atheist. However, I see this as a contradiction. To me, tolerating introlerance is not tolerance at all, but a jeopardising of freedom. As Dawkins famously said, let's stop being so damn tolerant!

Here's is an analogy that underlies the question: I can tolerate smokers even though I am not one. Their smoke stings in my eyes and makes my throat sore, but I tolerate them because they don't try to judge me or convince me to smoke (in general). Similarly, I can tolerate people who vote right-wing although I don't, as long as they do not try to convince me to do likewise. And so on and so forth. There is a difficulty in tolerating many religious persuasions; often one of their tenets seem to be intolerance *per se*. In other words, accepting them means accepting their criticism of my stance, and that, in turn, means submitting my freedom.

A formulated example was pointed out by Mark Cidade below (thanks!) in a Wikipedia on "Tolerating the intolerant" which, in turn, discusses Popper's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">paradox of tolerance</a>. That is apparently what my question is about. I wasn't aware that Popper (and others) had written about this. I might as well read them now. :-) Seti also makes a great contribution, expressing my concerns in much better words than my own.

Nonetheless, can tolerating intolerance be called tolerance? Or is it just an empty, politically correct facade with little logical support?
