I attended multiple private Catholic schools from Preschool through 8th grade. 

*The only real benefit I noticed from attending such a school was their extremely advanced English program. The things we were learning in the 8th grade (gerrund phrases come to mind) weren't even touched upon until the second or third year of college.* 

Are there any Atheist schools? I haven't seen or heard of any. Why not?
