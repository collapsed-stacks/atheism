Re-reading many questions and answers on this site, it seems to me that there is a wide range of views on the topic of respect towards religious beliefs and associated behaviours. Let me explain.

Imagine I am an atheist. If someone talks to me and expresses a deeply ingrained religious belief, do I "respect" them and just nod, or is it ethical to try to persuade them away from their nonsense? If it is not just the person talking, but children being indoctrinated and women or gays being discriminated against in the name of religion, am I supposed to be respectful again, or should I stop being respectful and raise my voice?

Some have argued on this site that we atheists "should not be jerks", because respect is extremely important. I do not buy that. Frankly, I am sick of being called a jerk just because I take action against what I believe to be aggresions from organised religion. As Dawkins famously said, "let's stop being so damned tolerant".

This position is supported by the fact that one of the pillars of most (all?) organised religions is the "conversion of the infidels", i.e. the proselytising of their own values, the belief that they own the only universal truth, and the censorship of others as simply wrong. It would be arguable that atheists should "proselytise" (I'd rather say "educate") as well in order to counteract the effect of organised religions.

At the same time, I think that respect is a great value, and I believe in a civilised approach to things in general. So, the question that bugs me no end is, where is the fine line that separates respect from indolence? Is atheism just a personal conviction, or is it also a social and cultural stance? If the latter, then I think that atheism pushes us away from the *laissez faire* and extreme relativism that some want us to believe. What do you think?
