I heard a lot of christians say that Hitler was a atheist militant, that there is strong evidence that confirms it, and they would make this statement appear undoubtful by adding "anyone knows that by now". But none of them provided any evidence for these claims...

So I'm asking here, is there any evidence that Hitler was indeed an atheist?

There is a ton of evidence to show he was and still is a Catholic. I will post it here, look them up for yourself if you doubt the quotes.

>    "I have followed [the Church] in giving our party program the character of unalterable finality, like the Creed. The Church has never allowed the Creed to be interfered with. It is fifteen hundred years since it was formulated, but every suggestion for its amendment, every logical criticism, or attack on it, has been rejected. The Church has realized that anything and everything can be built up on a document of that sort, no matter how contradictory or irreconcilable with it. The faithful will swallow it whole, so long as logical reasoning is never allowed to be brought to bear on it."

>    [Adolf Hitler, from Rauschning, _The Voice of Destruction_, pp. 239-40]

>    "My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery. When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exposed."

I can imagine a few objections that will be raised.

**Objection:** Hitler was no true Christian. <br />
**Reply:** None of them are.

**Objection:** Christians don't commit genocide. <br />
**Reply:** Look up the Albigensians, review your history of the Crusades, and what about the Jews of Spain? Did Darwin coin the word "pogrom"?

**Objection:** Hitler was merely cynically manipulating the German people by using their beliefs in God. <br />
**Reply:** I'd say something similar of his misuse of scientific theory.

**Objection:** You're doing the same thing we are, only instead of blaming Darwinism, you're blaming Christianity. <br />
**Reply:** No, I think humans have done evil throughout their history, and are always willing to grab any convenient rationalization for their behavior, whether it's science or religion or twinkies. Science doesn't dictate morality, and it's also rather clear that religion does a piss-poor job of it, too.

**Objection:** But evolution is a scientific theory that has more rhetorical and philosophical power than mere religion, and therefore must bear a greater weight of responsibility. <br />
**Reply:** I don't think the kind of people who blame mass murder on evolution will actually make this argument. Still, I'd just say what is, is. Science describes it and explains it, but doesn't tell us what we should do with it.

As @jonw and @Philip Muir mentioned, Hitler was a catholic at least when he wrote Mein Kampf. 

There is no logical problem answering that particular question. However, logical problem follows the question. When this question is followed by "So do you agree that [catholics|atheist] are evil?". When the catholic option is chosen, that is a wrong argument based on correct information; when the atheist option is chosen, that would then be a wrong argument based on false information. 

Thus, don't fall onto the trap...

   One of Hitlers motivations was that he survived some very dangerous episodes in WW1. He suffered from a common mystical delusion, that he was saved because a higher-power had a great purpose for him to accomplish. I think an atheist would instead look at the laws of probability and conclude that by chance a few people would come through enormous odds without the aid of divine intervention, and he was simply lucky.

Both theists and atheists have been trying to disown Hitler since the end of the war.

The theists mostly say that Hitler was publicly Christian because Germany is very Christian...Same as the US, you're not going to get far in politics if you stand up and avow yourself an Atheist. Remember, Hitler was very fond of Nietzsche and other "God is Dead" style Atheists, and very supportive of the pre-christian German myth cycles. They also like to *ad hominem* us by pointing out that Hitler is about as un-Christian as it is possible to be, if you compare his actions with Christianities stated ethos. 

On the other hand, Hitler constantly lambasted Atheism publicly because the Communists were all avowed atheists, and he hated the Slavs as much as the Jews and Gays.

Nazi Germany's genocide against the disabled (Action T4, which included the killing of the current Pope's cousin) was opposed by the Catholic Church.

That being said, there's a difference between saying "Hitler was an atheist, therefore atheism is bad" and saying "If we become an atheist society, and we reject the ten commandments as the basis of our legal system, what will we use as the basis of our legal and moral system, and what rights will we have?". The original poster didn't cite examples of people saying that Hitler was an atheist, so I don't know what they were saying.

<p>Nazism was not a secular, cold-blooded-rationalist movement, as it is sometimes portrayed by religious propaganda.  It had deep roots in German occult movements, and bathed in mysticism and esoteric symbolism.  See <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1852278633" rel="nofollow">The Invisible Eagle</a> for reference.  Also, "Race Science" was not a science at all, but an excellent example of a pseudo-science.</p>

The actual, official religion of the Nazi Party was something called "Positive Christianity", a form of Christianity which pretty much set aside every trace of "social doctrine", and focussed on the more "robust", "masculine" aspect of Christ. In that, it's somewhat similar to the views advocated by some on the US Right (though that's where the comparison ends). 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Christianity

Hitler himself was a confirmed Catholic who remained an official member of the Church until the day he died. There is simply no disputing that. He certainly explicitly credited his own survival in WWI to Divine Providence.

Hitler has NEVER advocated anything *remotely* close to Atheism, and the Nazis actively attempted to exterminate them along with Jews and Communists (which they saw as pretty much all the same thing). 

So please, anyone who claims Hitler was an Atheist is either conflating atheists such as Stalin and Mao with Hitler (they agreed on little, EXCEPT the little value they attributed to the lives of humans other than themselves), or they are in an explicit, dishonest campaign to slander atheists and Atheism itself. Mostly the second.

I find it extraordinarily offensive, evil even, for believers to come here and attempt to blame the victim. Atheists like us died in the thousands under the Nazi boot. To invent an Atheist Bogeyman in Hitler out of whole cloth, with absolutely no evidence whatsoever, is extraordinarily evil.

We can discuss the role of Atheism in the Stalinist purges, or in the Chinese Communist "re-education" camps. I believe there is none, but that is something at least which bears discussion. But with the Nazis, no. The Nazis were **officially** Christian, and they were so unofficially as well. The Nazis equated Atheism with Communism, its avowed mortal enemy (let's not forget: the Nazis considered the Communists to be ever more dangerous enemies than the Jews, when they didn't simply equate the two altogether). There is no way the Nazis, or Hitler, was an Atheist. 

I repeat, for the Nazis, Communism = Atheism = Judaism. Their rhetoric, films, entire written production, their art, everything supports this idea. Communism = Atheism = Judaism. And they killed as many of all three as they could get their hands on.

&lt;/rant&gt;
