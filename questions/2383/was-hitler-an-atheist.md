I heard a lot of christians say that Hitler was a atheist militant, that there is strong evidence that confirms it, and they would make this statement appear undoubtful by adding "anyone knows that by now". But none of them provided any evidence for these claims...

So I'm asking here, is there any evidence that Hitler was indeed an atheist?
