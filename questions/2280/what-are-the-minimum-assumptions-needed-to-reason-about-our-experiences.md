When discussing atheism, I often run into a problem where I dig a bit too deep into my own assumptions and beliefs and am left unable to answer any questions at all. In particular, it happened this time when trying to entertain the notion "God transcends logic" and can thus resolve logical paradoxes.

I feel like the assumption that "logic applies" is necessary for any discussion. What are some other things we *need* to have for an argument to be made?
