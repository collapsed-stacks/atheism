When discussing atheism, I often run into a problem where I dig a bit too deep into my own assumptions and beliefs and am left unable to answer any questions at all. In particular, it happened this time when trying to entertain the notion "God transcends logic" and can thus resolve logical paradoxes.

I feel like the assumption that "logic applies" is necessary for any discussion. What are some other things we *need* to have for an argument to be made?

I think the biggest assumptions you need are tied in with the definitions of the points up for debate.  If there is no common agreement as to the definition of god, religion, heaven, hell, even the supernatural, then you're behind the proverbial 8-ball.  

To stick with your example, "god transcends logic" gives us no wisdom about what god is supposed to be, and, therefore is neither proveable nor disproveable.  To illustrate the importance of a good definition, I could define god as the series of natural phenomena that led to the creation of the universe, all matter, and all life -- both known and unknown to us.  Few within our community would be able to argue that this "god" doesn't exist, although some might question why I chose such a loaded word to use for that definition.  But then, I doubt you'll find many theists who would support the use of this definition, so the debate is unlikely to get anywhere with this definition either. 

We actually see this point brought up any time a theist tries to argue that atheism is a religion.  By giving your thesis a definition that supports your preferred outcome, you have effectively nullified the debate before it began.

How about the rules of debating? "No moving the goalposts" would be a great one. I would add "no appeals to the bible," but I doubt any theist would take me up on it.

 - No undefined terms
 - No unsupported claims
 - No logically flawed arguments

Of course if the person's claim is that "God transcends logic", he may not accept the requirement to abide by logic.

But ask the person on what basis he believes it to be true if logic cannot be applied. As far as I can tell, it's just a nonsense statement.

When someone wants to do away with evidence and reason in order to allow room for God, one approach is to demonstrate other absurd claims you can make which must then also be accepted on the same grounds (often: other gods, leprechauns, unicorns, alien visitation, etc).
