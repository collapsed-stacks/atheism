Several people here have been asking for a proper response to (common) theist arguments. I wonder whether there are questions which cannot be handled properly even though the interlocutor is logical and sincerly interested in the discussion.

Not every question has a proper answer, right?

So what are the most difficult questions for atheists? I mean the questions which bring the least convincing answers (from the best atheist answers).
