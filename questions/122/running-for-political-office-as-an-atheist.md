Every couple of years I consider filing the paperwork to run for either state office or Congress (knowing full well I'd have a snowball's chance in South Texas of getting any votes) just because I feel that voting isn't enough, and that part of our civic duty as citizens is to participate in government as fully as possible (you may roll your eyes now).

But...

Article I, Section 4 of the Texas State Constitution has this bit of language:

<blockquote>
RELIGIOUS TESTS.  No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust, in this State; nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments, <em>provided he acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being</em>.</blockquote>

Emphasis mine.  I'm a little-a atheist; I do not acknowledge the existence of a supreme being.  If I read this correctly, this means that if I want to be honest with myself and everyone else about my beliefs, I cannot hold state office in Texas.  

Can a clause like this be challenged before a US court?  If so, what would be the basis?  

**Edit**

Since posting the question I've done some random googling (which is what passes for research these days), and the general consensus seems to be that, if challenged, the provision would be struck down on 1st Amendment and Article 6 grounds, so it simply isn't enforced.  I imagine the same is true for the other states that have constitutional provisions like this.  

Note that this is entirely a separate issue from getting anyone to *vote* for an atheist, especially around here.  I mean, that wouldn't be the platform (*Vote for me!  I reject you and everything you stand for!  I'm perfect for the job!*), but if asked I'd have to be honest.
