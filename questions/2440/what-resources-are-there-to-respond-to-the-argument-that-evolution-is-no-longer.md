I have heard the argument the "evolution" is not longer accepted in scientific circles. This is clearly nonsense, but are there any lists of universities and/or scientists who publicly affirm the fact of evolution? I need concise, solid evidence and not just the impressions gained from reading lots of books and blogs... this person is not going to go and read all of them.

The person who makes this argument affirms that evolution will break their entire fundamentalist Christian religion if it is true, so I think it is relevant on an atheism site in this case.

As an aside, the person who makes this argument clearly doesn't have the faintest idea what evolution is, but "The Greatest Show On Earth" will fix that... :)

To start the list, I like the link below where Michael Behe's university says that he is alone in his views:
