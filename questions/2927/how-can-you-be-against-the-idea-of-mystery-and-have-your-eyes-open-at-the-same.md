This question comes via Jennifer Michael Hecht. She asked it rhetorically and followed up with “it doesn’t make sense.” She was talking about her book “Doubt: A History” and noted that historically doubters have not been in a turf war like the current science vs religion debate. As Epicurus, an early atheist, said, “it feels good to pray, you might as well.” 

She further explained that recognizing that there is mystery does not require that you have to fill in the blanks with imaginary ideas. She lays out that 

 - People have feelings of faith manifested in many ways, through traditional church or personal journeys in the wilderness. There is no reason to feel a need to control that. 
 - We can explore it, celebrate it and embrace it as part of being human. 
 - Controlling how people abuse these feelings, how they fill in the blanks, and how they coerce others to believe that their imagination is reality is a different matter and not part of this question. 

Her book came out in 2003, before the “The God Delusion”. Since then, I would say the climate has swung even more towards the “turf war” than away from it. I am interested in direct responses to the questions as well as responses to her position and how it speaks to being open minded as an atheist.

So the question remains, 
“How can you be against the idea of mystery and have your eyes open at the same time?”
