Background: I am a (mostly closeted) atheist. Most of my family and many of my social circles are either very religious or very sympathetic to religious viewpoints. They are good, kind people who are more fearful of atheism than outright hostile to it. However, because of this, my real-world support structure for like-minded atheists is very slim. So I turn to the interwebs.

What I find is community after online community of combative, self-congratulating echo chambers that alternate between planning strategies for sparring with non-atheists and mocking their general stupidity. Even here (which I have much higher hopes for, given the success of my ultimate time-sink, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/67">Stackoverflow</a>), skimming the home page I see words like *confront*, *debate*, *argument*. This is very disheartening. I am afraid atheists have earned their reputation as smug assholes, rather than being a smear by non-atheists. Is this perception way off-base? If it is, where do I need to be looking? If not, how can we help shift our own community mindset from adversarial to compassionate outreach?
