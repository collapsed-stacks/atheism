A lot of my Christian friends are giving up Facebook/alcohol/certain foods, etc., for Lent, which begins today. In the context of dieting I have seen studies done that show that abstaining from food for a period of time has little effect on weight - it may come off while you stop eating but your body will pile it on again once you start again. 

Is there any evidence of the effects of abstinence in relation to alcohol etc., or in general? (I haven't had much luck finding anything as US sex-ed policy tends to dominate any search.)
