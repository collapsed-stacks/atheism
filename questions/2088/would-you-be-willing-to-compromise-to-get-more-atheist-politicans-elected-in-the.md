As a minority group, non-believers have by far the largest gap in representation at both the federal and state levels in the US. As a member of this minority would you be willing to put aside your political ideology or ideas and value a prospective candidate's atheism over their political platform in order to further the cause of the group as a whole?  


Seems like most atheists fall into either of two political ideologies: Liberal or Libertarian. So the question is: should we put such ideologies on the back burner in order to help the general cause of atheism?


Edit:  Five answers all saying no basically.  I just wanted to add this to give another side.  I actually am with the five answers here but here is a discussion where an actual politician argues for the opposite.
