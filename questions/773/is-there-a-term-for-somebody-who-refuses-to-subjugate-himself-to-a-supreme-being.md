Is there a commonly used term for somebody who may or may not believe that there is a supreme being but who refuses to subjugate himself to such a being's whims? Admittedly, most people in this camp are likely to be in the "not believe" camp, but I would be interested to know if there is a name for people like this.

*Edit*

I agree that this might not seem to be a philosophically tenable position to many of us, but I would genuinely like to know if there is technical term for this belief system.
