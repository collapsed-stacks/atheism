I often watch *insert fox news show here* (to see other viewpoints) and I have been noticing many of the notable Christian anti-atheist talking heads are actually rooting for a secular Egypt.  I know they are worried about strict Islamic rule and in their minds they must be justifying it based on a "lesser of two evils" approach.        

I thought this raised an interesting point though.  These particular correspondents are leading the charge when it comes to trying to move the U.S. away from being a secular state and are always talking about "fundamental Judeo-Christian values on which this country was founded".  Is it fair to use this as an argument supporting Atheism and secular values by pointing out the hypocrisy?  How would you counter the argument that a purely Judeo-Christian state would somehow be better than a strict "Sharia Law" Islamic state?       

*** I realize "secular state" != no religion / atheism. ***
