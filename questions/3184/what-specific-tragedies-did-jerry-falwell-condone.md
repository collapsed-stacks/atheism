Jerry Falwell was a man of many words, and had a profound influence over US politics and culture.  Whether in his broadcast or otherwise, what specific tragedies did Jerry Falwell condone ? For the sake of defining tragedy, please refer to events resulting in the apparently senseless loss of life.

His unflinching support for Israel gave him the unofficial title of "Christian Zionist," so if you would count the occupation as a "tragedy," that would qualify.

Likewise, he was critical of sanctions against South Africa due to its Apartheid regime.  (He criticized Desmond Tutu a fraud "as far as representing the black people of South Africa".)

And, of course, he said, in response to the September 11 attacks, "I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen."
