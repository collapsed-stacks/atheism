## How do religious people both claim God works in mysterious ways while also claiming to know what God wants us to do?

It seems a lot of religious people claim to know what god wants us to eat and wear and who can marry whom and so on.

At the same time when you point to something that seems unreasonable of God to, like asking that guy in the bible to sacrifice his son, or saving one passenger in a plane crash while letting everybody else die, they start saying that we as humans can't understand it. Ie. god works in mysterious ways.

Has anyone seen a religious person try to defend this contradictory position and was their defense "interesting" or just some standard meaningless blah blah?
