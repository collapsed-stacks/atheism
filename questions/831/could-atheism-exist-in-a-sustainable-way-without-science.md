At one point in the evolutionary history of our species, we were all atheists. I think that this is fairly self-evident. If _homo sapiens_ has always been religious (as seems to be the case), then go back to _homo erectus_. If _homo erectus_ was religious (as might have been the case), go back to the species before that. At some point, all of our ancestors were atheists. 

We then stumbled upon religion and that spread to the entire species.

At some point though, we discovered a rational interpretation of the universe that is able to work with a minimum of assumptions: science. This freed large portions of the population from the need (?) for religious explanations. As we all no doubt know, the profession with the largest percentage of atheists is science and within science biology. It seems pretty unambiguous that it's science that freed us from our bondage.

Is there something else that could have sparked the transformation from the only (?) religious species back to the default (natural?) state of atheism that our species is currently going through or is science the one ticket out?
