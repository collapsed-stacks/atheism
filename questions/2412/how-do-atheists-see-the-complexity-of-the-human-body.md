Looking at the mere complexity of the human eye itself I can't help but look at that and say that there's an intelligent creator out there.  Can you help me understand an Athiest's perspective on the complexity of the human body and how they can look at the complexity involved and still believe there's no creator?  The idea that humans can just think "I wish I had another arm" enough in their lives and they eventually adapt having another arm doesn't make sense to me.
