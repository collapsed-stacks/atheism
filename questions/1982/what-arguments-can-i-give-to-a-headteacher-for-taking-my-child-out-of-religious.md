I have a meeting with the head teacher at a church funded school to explain why I want my 5 year old child taken out of RE and other religious activities. There are no available secular options in the area and it does annoy me when the church gets opportunities to indoctrinate kids. 

I don't want to come across as rude or have a long drawn out discussion, so I'm just looking for some simple potent arguments that work. Ideas?
