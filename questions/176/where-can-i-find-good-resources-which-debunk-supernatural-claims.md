I must admit that some things are so strange that it's too easy to say "maybe it was supernatural". What good resources on the web explain how some of these *amazing* deeds were achieved (in case of hoaxes), or at least, what led (so many) people to believe them? I'm thinking here stuff like witchcraft, sightings, visions, satanism...
