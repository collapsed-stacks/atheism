Over at school, we have this chapter on religion (and it's part of the syllabus), and stating my views on the subject didn't get me any points with the teacher. He thinks I'm "unenlightened", and says stuff like "You'll understand when you grow up..." (:P ... I'm 15.)

I find such behaviour irritating and ***holistic at best. What's the best way to deal with such a person?

School is a test that you have to pass. You can just play the game, tell them what they want to hear. Then when you become a parent you can start to change the system. (what I did)

I wish I was in your situation and had the resources available now. If you can involve your parents (assuming they are supportive of your belief). Or you could get in touch with your local Critical Thinking group or Atheist group and ask them to advise you are even assist you in contacting your school. Always be polite, its your greatest weapon. Know your facts, dont be lead down the path of proving your stand point, the burden of proof is always with the adult who makes the claim there is a God. Dont get bogged down in the details.

I think if you have gotten this far you will be able to stand up for yourself and would love to hear how you get on. Listen to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe and Skeptoid on itunes to learn how to defend your position against the "Woo" While not Atheist in nature the pocasts will teach you how to stand up for your world views.

All the best

<p>This an opportunity to be astute and learn how to apply neutral critical thinking. It is also an opportunity to contact <a href="http://au.org/" rel="nofollow">au.org</a> (US) or a similar organization in your country to learn how to fight for secularism in education and society.</p>

<p>AU will take cases (<a href="http://www.au.org/take-action/report-a-violation/" rel="nofollow">reported by people like you</a>) and make challenges for you in court. <a href="http://blog.au.org/2009/06/11/freshwaters-fetid-filing-ohio-teacher-sues-to-continue-classroom-religion/" rel="nofollow">One case</a> involved a teacher  began with him teaching intelligent design in science classes, and ended up with him allegedly burning a cross into a students arm. </p>

<p>If I surmise correctly, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_India" rel="nofollow">you live in a secular state</a>, you have a right to not be indoctrinated, though education on the topic of religion may be permissible if done with equity. Of course, for Americans or Europeans that word is nebulous considering "<a href="http://gandhifoundation.org/2009/05/27/gandhi-and-secularism/" rel="nofollow">Gandhiâ€™s vision of the secular state</a> is a place where religious values and discourse are cherished and respected in all spheres of life, the public as well as the private, but in which no single religion is allowed to dominate the others".</p>

The middle years in school (roughly all of high school and college up to a bachelor's degree) will primarily teach you ONE thing:  How to follow procedure.  It's why many careers don't care what your college degree is in, so long as you have one.  The important thing is not that you gain a particular piece of knowledge, but that you learn how to follow directions, play with the team, etc.  It's never an overt part of the lesson plan, but the sooner you learn it the better your education will go.

You will often find a teacher/professor who is "wrong" about something.  They may have old information that they've never updated, they may have blinders in a particular area, they may be trying to see which students will show initiative, pursue outside research, and liven up classroom debate.  Or they may have a greater perspective and be "right" in ways you won't understand until later in the class or your education.  How you deal with these educators is important to defining yourself, and what grades you get.

At the age of 15, your academic career can probably afford to fight the teacher.  Or you can sit back, let him be "right" for now, and go on with your life.  On either path, you will learn things about self control, interacting with others, and religion.  You might get a better grade on one path, but is this a grade which will matter for long?  I would say the most important thing to do is to keep the discussion civil and intellectual.  The debate skills could be your greatest gain.

There something to be said for attempting to argue the opponent's position for them. It's a standard rhetoric training method, and it truly sharpens the mind. So I would recommend that you try your best to justify the textbook position from your teacher's point of view. See where it holds together, and where it doesn't. Don't be afraid that your skepticism will somehow be polluted, or weakened by this exercise. Take it as a mental training exercise, and be assured that if you approach the subject honestly, the stronger position will come out on top, in yourself if you're not able to express it openly for the time being.
