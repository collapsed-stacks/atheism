Over at school, we have this chapter on religion (and it's part of the syllabus), and stating my views on the subject didn't get me any points with the teacher. He thinks I'm "unenlightened", and says stuff like "You'll understand when you grow up..." (:P ... I'm 15.)

I find such behaviour irritating and ***holistic at best. What's the best way to deal with such a person?
