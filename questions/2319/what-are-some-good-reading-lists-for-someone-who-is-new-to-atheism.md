*Why I Am Not A Christian*, Bertrand Russell (available to read online at http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm)

*The God Delusion*, Richard Dawkins

*God Is Not Great*, Christopher Hitchens

*The End of Faith* and *Letter to a Christian Nation*, Sam Harris

Oh, and enter 'Hitchslap' into Youtube. Hitchens is the master of the pithy remark.

"The Salmon of Doubt" by Douglas Adams. It sounds strange, but Adams talks quite a bit about his reasons for becoming an atheist.

The Future of an Illusion by Sigmund Freud

On Reason by Tom Paine

The Jefferson Bible (Thomas Jefferson took the bible and edited out the unreasonable sections)

For fiction, I'd also recommend Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman
