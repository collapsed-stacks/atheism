What false or misleading anti-theistic claims (like the one listed [here](http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/1071/has-anyone-found-any-supporting-materials-that-confirm-repudiate-this-oft-cited-s)) have you encountered?

Ideally, provide a link to both an example of the claim and sources refuting it.

Studies showing that **atheists are smarter than theists**, like the one by Kanazawa. In fact, these studies are poorly executed and donâ€™t show conclusive results at all. Furthermore, any study measuring intelligence has to overcome some pretty high obstacles to account for local differences, inexact measures, the inherent problems of IQ testing and many other factors.

For a good refutation of such studies, see [PZ Myers](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/02/stop_patting_yourselves_on_the.php), and [him again](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/07/whos_smarter_than_who.php).

<p>The claim that the Vatican City's age of consent is 12 looks like it is bogus: <a href="http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/1243/what-is-the-age-of-consent-laws-of-vatican-city-closed">What is the age of consent laws of Vatican City? [closed]</a>.</p>

Worst argument by a wide margin is the claim that **Jesus never existed**, or that he's **a reinvention of other dying god-men**. Sorry to say this, but these claims are based on 150 year old, out-dated scholarship, and its an extremely minority opinion among historians today.

See <a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=25009">this discussion</a> for a detailed listing of gods presumed to be prototypes, and how they stack up against the actual myths.

Long story short: Jesus certainly existed, even if his the details of his life are lost in myth and legend.

<p>The movie Zeitgeist was full of momentarily compelling claims that where ment to be damning to some core Christian claims.  It turns out most of it was bogus.  The <a href="http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Zeitgeist" rel="nofollow">ironchariouts.org wiki</a> has a great writeup of what was wrong with the religious part of the movie.</p>
