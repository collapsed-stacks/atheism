We have heard of violent religious groups that attack people from other beliefs.
Are there any groups that promote violence against religious people and proclaim themselves atheists?

Example: I have heard that some atheist governments do that, I don't know if they admit it.
In the case of governments their violence is relabeled as justice, and religious people call it persecution.

**PS**: Since some people don't consider government justice as a form of violence, I would like to include as possible answers "every group whose enemy is religion and whose methods are physical repression."
