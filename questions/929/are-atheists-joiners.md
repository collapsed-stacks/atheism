## Are atheists "joiners"?

I've seen several questions asking about specifically atheist groups, which has me wondering a few things.  

I'm not a "joiner" in general (some days I border on outright misanthropy), I've never had a need for a support group as such (my family are awesomely tolerant), and frankly, most Big-A (a.k.a Gnu) Atheists manage to piss me off enough that one of the last things I want to do is join a specifically atheist organization (as opposed to an organization where many if not most of the members may also be atheists, but they're not there *because* they're atheists, if that makes any sense). 

Does that make me unusual among atheists?  I have a core group of friends that I enjoy spending time with, but one of the few things we *don't* have in common is our views towards religion (several of my oldest and closest friends are actually quite religious without being Bible thumpers), and I'd rather hang out with them than join any freethinker or atheists groups.  

Again, does that fall outside the norm for other atheists?
