I am not sure she is, I am aware she has spoken out saying she has no religious belief but there is a big difference.

Yes she is. She was asked during an interview if she believed in god, and she replied 'No, I don't.'

This is actually a complex issue, I started looking into this after the last question. Apparently, it isn't so clear cut. Wikipedia won't permit the word "Atheist" on her bio, or in her political categorization. There is no evidence to her identifying as an atheist, but she certainly doesn't identify as being a theist either. I suppose again we're back to defining an "atheist" as a non-theist, or an adherent of a belief system. I won't answer this again, it has been beaten to death already. It is safe to say she doesn't believe in god; however, it is disputable if her proper self-identity is as an Atheist, or an Agnostic.

See the online dialog from the wikipedia discussion:

Gillard claims she's an atheist, but she's secretly a <s>Muslim</s> Catholic - she supported [taxpayer funds for the canonization of Mary McKillop](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-election/gillard-promises-15m-for-miracle-20100805-11kt3.html) in the last election campaign, possibly trying to one-up the openly religious opposition leader Tony Abbott.
