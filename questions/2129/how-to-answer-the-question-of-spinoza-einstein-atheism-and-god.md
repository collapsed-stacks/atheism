From time to time I find myself in conversation or debate with theists, and the notion that "Even the greatest scientists believed in God" comes up.  Frequently Einstein is mentioned. 

Einstein said. 
> "The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this."

But, he also refers to God in his famous line. 
> "God does not play dice."

There's a notion out there that people like Einstein and many other scientists may have believed in, and that's Spinoza's god.  This is a 'god' that is abstract, impersonal, and completely uninvolved in the universe.

**My question is this. What is the best way to answer the assertion of Einstein, Spinoza and others believing in 'God' - when it's clear that they didn't *at all* mean the same thing as a recognizable theist god?**
