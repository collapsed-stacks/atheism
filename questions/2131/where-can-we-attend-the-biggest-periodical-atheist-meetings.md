Are there any weekly or yearly meetings for atheists? To talk and hear about this subject and related ones?

There are a lot of meeting resources listed here:
http://www.atheistalliance.org/

I just saw that their calendar isn't updated for 2011.

So here are a couple of links:
http://www.atheists.org/events/National_Convention - April 2011

Here's a world-wide meetup page:
http://atheists.meetup.com/

Here's the American Atheist calendar:

The Freedom From Religion Foundation (http://www.ffrf.org/) has an annual convention.  This year, it'll be in Hartford, CT.
