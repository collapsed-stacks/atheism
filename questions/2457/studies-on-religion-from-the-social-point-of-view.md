Are there any interesting books or websites analyzing religious behaviors from the social point of view and that reference atheism or secularism as a baseline? I am interested in a comparison of social acceptance of religious behavior as compared to non-religious.

Let me give a few examples of topics I expect to see in those books:

 - Consequences of religious rules on participants' life
 - Religious rules and integration
 - Rules, which cause success of religion
 - Identification of patterns in religous myths from the social point of view

Other examples:

 - Have the Shabbath rules made the Jews more isolated compared to other believers?
 - What leads to the success of Christians in Roman empire?
