Are there any interesting books or websites analyzing religious behaviors from the social point of view and that reference atheism or secularism as a baseline? I am interested in a comparison of social acceptance of religious behavior as compared to non-religious.

Let me give a few examples of topics I expect to see in those books:

 - Consequences of religious rules on participants' life
 - Religious rules and integration
 - Rules, which cause success of religion
 - Identification of patterns in religous myths from the social point of view

Other examples:

 - Have the Shabbath rules made the Jews more isolated compared to other believers?
 - What leads to the success of Christians in Roman empire?

Peter Berger sounds like a match. I have read "Religious America, Secular Europe?" which looks at why Europe secularized and asks if America is really an outlier in the modernization/secularization trend. I just ordered "The Social Construction of Reality", the basis for some of his other work. "The Sacred Canopy" might also be a fit.

Nietzsche has fascinating things to say of this nature on Jews and Christians. He covers it in *Genealogy of Ethics* and *The Antichrist*.

My coworker Cristina SÃ¡nchez-Carretero has published extensively on this topic, especially in relation to Afro-Dominican religious practices and the relationship between religious practices and migration. You can have a look at some of her publications <a href="http://csic.academia.edu/CristinaS%C3%A1nchezCarretero/Papers">here</a> and <a href="http://csic.academia.edu/CristinaS%C3%A1nchezCarretero/Books">here</a>.
