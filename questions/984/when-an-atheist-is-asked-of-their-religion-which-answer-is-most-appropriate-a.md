I would be inclined to say "none", because "atheist" isn't a religion. But it's still a common response among atheists. With that said though, if I'm ever *trying* to be controvertial, I'd say "atheist" because it seems to carry more weight.

In the interest of being counted in our respective countries, it is important to get this one right in questionnaires by stipulating 'no religion' rather than ticking the 'other' or 'none of the above' box .  Similarly, I agree, Atheism or Agnosticism is not a religion.

If you were apolitical and were asked "what is your political party" or "what party would you vote", I guess you would answer "none" rather than "apolitical". Hence, "none" is the logical answer.

Being an atheist is the reason why you answer "none", but it is not the best answer, in my opinion.

I am more likely to say "I am Atheist" (with weight on the A) than I am "I am an Atheist" I find it has a better sound. This is very hard to put across in text but I think there is a huge difference. I feel using "I am a Atheist" I am implying I am a member of a group which is not yours. 

Sorry if this does not make much sense as I am not great with words.

10 out of 10 for "None. I'm an atheist."  I would say "None, I'm Atheist"

"Atheist" is better in that it helps to awaken the world to a growing demographic and encourages solidarity between like minded people. If Atheists can only be found when you turn over rocks it doesn't help our plight.

I would say: "I'm not religious", while clearly answering the question, it avoids going into finer details of your convictions.

I don't like the "none" option, because there are plenty of theists who don't subscribe to any particular religion and are likely to use this option. 

Atheists shouldn't be lumped in with them.

Such questions are often poorly phrased, making it clear that atheism is not anticipated or understood as different than "none".

None.

Depending on the context, I may or may not be inclined to offer the fact that I'm an atheist and/or whatever positive philosophical view(s) I happen to actually have (as atheism alone is just a counter-position).
