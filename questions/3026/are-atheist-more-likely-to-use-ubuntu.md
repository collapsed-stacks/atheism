Most people use Windows for two main reasons, (a) "everyone" else uses it, and (b) it is handed down from generation to generation with the vast majority of new computers. It is often used with such user reluctance to change that it seems like people continue to use it and other expensive Operating Systems out of fear, like some kind of religion.

It seems that atheists are more likely to question paradigms and the status quo, and to research the benefits and flaws of Operating systems. Are they more likely to use the operating system Ubuntu?

Ubuntu seems like the antithesis to that Windows and OSX mentality. It requires independence and intelligence (you have to choose to scrap whatever OS you currently have and know how to install it), it requires continued diligence and some perseverance (a certain amount of tenacity is required upgrade to upgrrade), and Ubuntu is very individualistic (it can be built up however you want, you can even compile it yourself). All of these traits seem to tie into the atheist personality.

Is there a study or any kind of resource that might point to the breakdown of OS's by religious (non-)affiliation?

This ("Are atheist more likely to use ubuntu?") is the typical question that some people may laugh at, but it can be experimentally tested and statistically approached. Whether or not is *useful*, that's another issue. :-)

In any case, I think the question starts from a false premise:

> most people use windows just because
> it is used by most people instead of
> doing some research or thought on it
> just like religion

Would you say that "most people wear clothes just because they are worn by most people instead of doing some research or thought on it just like religion?" Or would you say that "most people eat three times a day (rather than one or ten) just because that's what most people do instead of doing some research or thought on it just like religion?"

My point is that convention has great advantages: it eases friction, and makes life easier. There's a large gap between adopting convention and being a brainless sheep, though. I am all against being a sheep, but I acknowledge the value of convention.

**EDIT**: Another example I can offer was that of a (rather dumb) acquaintance of mine, who once said: "Why do Chinese people use these silly chopsticks? They should do some research into something better like forks and spoons before just mimicking each other and adopting chopsticks without further thought". This is flawed reasoning, again, because it is not taking into account the value of convention. Besides, not everyone has the inclination, time and knowledge to do "research". Same goes for Windows vs. Ubuntu: my mom, for example, wants something that works and which she can use straightaway. She is not willing to do "research"; she is comfortable with convention. Only a very small minority of us are willing and able to do that research that you call for.

So, I fully disagree with your claim that people's use of Windows is akin to religion. Windows is just a useful convention that eliminates unnecessary barriers. Atheists, as far as I understand, should not be especially non-pragmatic, and therefore I can't see why they would go against a valuable convention. If I am right, atheists should use Windows as much as anybody else, and Ubuntu likewise.

Meh, at best it is a correlation.

Also, I don't think many atheists care about what OS they are running.

On the other hand though, you might be able to do a study on if linux users are more likely to be atheists.  Most (although not all) of the linux users I know are either atheists, i-don't-really-care-unless-it-has-blinky-lights-on-it-ists, skeptics/agnostics, or liberal theists.  Still, that is entirely anecdotal, and actual research would need to be done to find any actual correlation.

Atheist and Windows user here. I think the correlation between atheism and Ubuntu\Linux is as follows:

 1. People who use Ubuntu\Linux are nerds.
 2. Nerds don't care about religion; they care about technology.
 3. Therefore, you could say that a lot of people who use Ubuntu\Linux also don't care about religion.

By the way, I'm also a professional developer\nerd myself and I use Ubuntu but not as my primary OS in any sense.

I'm an atheist and ubuntu-user, and I can draw some parallels. I could argue, that more educated people more often tend towards atheism and ubuntu than less educated people (but not the other way round). 

Linux is a transparent system, and is developed in an open process. You don't need to believe anything but may inspect everything. There are no priests but, on the other hand, there are gurus. :) 

Linux is more related to rebellion. There is more pluralism and therefore less dogma, but not all religions are dogmatic. 

Summa summarum the connections Linux-Atheism are very vague. Religious people surely can argue the other way. In fact, as a moderator of the german ubuntuusers.de, I experienced a fundamentalistic Christ, who was convinced that Ubuntu is a Christian thing and fits perfectly into his world view. 

(We got rid of him :) )

It might be just a correlation 

 - jounger people => more likely to use
   computers than older people and    
 - jounger people => more likely to be
   atheists than older people

Maybe a related question: Is atheism related to sex? I don't see much women around here. (And not on linux too. But maybe not on MS-Sites as well.)
