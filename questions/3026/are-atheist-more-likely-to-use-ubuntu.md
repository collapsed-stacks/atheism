Most people use Windows for two main reasons, (a) "everyone" else uses it, and (b) it is handed down from generation to generation with the vast majority of new computers. It is often used with such user reluctance to change that it seems like people continue to use it and other expensive Operating Systems out of fear, like some kind of religion.

It seems that atheists are more likely to question paradigms and the status quo, and to research the benefits and flaws of Operating systems. Are they more likely to use the operating system Ubuntu?

Ubuntu seems like the antithesis to that Windows and OSX mentality. It requires independence and intelligence (you have to choose to scrap whatever OS you currently have and know how to install it), it requires continued diligence and some perseverance (a certain amount of tenacity is required upgrade to upgrrade), and Ubuntu is very individualistic (it can be built up however you want, you can even compile it yourself). All of these traits seem to tie into the atheist personality.

Is there a study or any kind of resource that might point to the breakdown of OS's by religious (non-)affiliation?
