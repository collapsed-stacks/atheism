This came to be via David James Duncan, author of "The River Why" and "The Brothers K", two bestsellers the include references to the oneness of the universe, but are definitely not religious. He has received criticism from both theists and atheists. To quote from his book "God, Laughs and Plays",

So, the question is, is this rubbish or not? Before exploring Christianity directly, I frequently came across Biblical references in other texts and couldn't fully understand them. So I can see that side of it.

 - Will the current interpretations of the Bible that are commonly portrayed on TV and in megachurches harm the ability of future generations to understand those references? 
 - The underlying question: Is there is anything there (in the texts) worth preserving?

David James Duncan and I would agree that there is, so if your answer is that there isn't, please provide some reasoning for it. To add a little clarification, answers should be referring to the actual content in holy writings, and not simply allusions to content, and whether its meaning is relevant and endangered by the fringe or phantasmagorical influences of religious sideshows.

Opinions of the Bible as a piece of literature, or fixture in literature, are not pertinent. I'm assuming that is indicated by its use in literature by Steinbeck, Faulkner, Shakespeare, Leo Tolstoy, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkein, George Bernard Shaw, Toni Morrison, James Joyce, John Milton, John Bunyan and many others, and the common phrases in use such as “milk and honey”, “an eye for an eye”, “right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing”, “Promised Land” and many others. If you are making a case against, please include some sort of reference to those uses.
