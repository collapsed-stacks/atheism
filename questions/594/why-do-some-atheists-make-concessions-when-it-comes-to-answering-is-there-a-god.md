If someone asks you if there is a 100 foot tall man in Kansas, do you feel uncomfortable in saying "No"? How about if they ask you if you have a dead body in your closet? Do you say "We can never be sure, so in probability no, but one can never say"?

Why not say "There is no God", without qualification?  Are you afraid that you might be wrong?  Well, haven't you ever been wrong?

Do you ever make affirmative, positive, unambiguous denials?  If you do, and you call yourself an atheist, why not say "There is no God".  Everyone understands that if you are shown to be wrong, you'll accept it.

What's the point of being a weak atheist?  Shows that you are open-minded?  Are you open-minded about fornicating with a dead cat if someone said that there are therapeutic effects to doing so?  Or do you simply say "No, I do not believe that there are therapeutic effects of fucking a cat, but one can never say never"?
