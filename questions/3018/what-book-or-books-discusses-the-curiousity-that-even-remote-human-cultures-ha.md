There is a book that I happened upon one time which discussed the curious fact that most human civilizations, no matter how remote, have devised some concept of a creator or religion. I had all but forgotten it until I saw [a question about societies being devoid of religion][1].

Essentially it covers the psychological phenomenon where humans are often unable to contend with unknown answers; as such they will create them rather than await evidence. Is anyone familiar with a book like what I am describing?

<p>One book that covers such topics is <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/067003472X" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Spell</a> by Daniel Dennett.</p>

<p>Among other things, he talks about the evolutionary and psychological explanations of why people have a strong tendency toward religious beliefs.</p>

<p>In searching for the book I once came across, the title, <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/034544034X" rel="nofollow">Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief</a> seemed familiar. While it has less to do with early or remote civilizations, it does deal with the reasons why humans come up with supernatural explanations for the unknown.</p>
