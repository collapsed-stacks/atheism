I've recently been reading a lot about Atheists being a political minority. I wanted to throw out an idea, and see if anyone knows of any research on it. Is it possible that atheists are a political minority because we're less likely to identify as "centrists". Most of the Atheists I've met identify with either the Libertarian party, or are at least as left as Democratic-socialists, or the modern Green-Party.. Is there is significant overlap, so much so that we can accredit our non-electability to our party affiliations rather than our religious standing?

* Are Atheists significantly more likely to identify with minor parties?
* How much of Atheists-electability is tied to party affiliation?
* Is there a resource that would track Atheists' party identification?
* Would that be a fair metric? Or, would it be significantly blurred by third-party candidates running in a major party for straight-line voter support?
