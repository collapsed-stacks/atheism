Which god? You have almost 3000 to choose from so it would help to know exactly which god you are not sure exists or is it all gods you are not sure of.

If you need help to determine if any particular god exists then we need to know what the claims are for the existence of this god. Then we can compare the claims made to what we see in reality.

Not in the traditional sense. Per Peter's answer we need a definition of something to judge it's existence, and there is no consensus on a definition of God. Does a rock exist? Yes- if we are speaking of a specific rock that we can identify as such. But as to the question in it's literal sense, we encounter much shakier ground. Do we speak of the concept of a rock, the word 'rock', or maybe the quality of a rock? And while it seems all these do exist- it is not immediately clear what we are talking about. All these answers are an affirmative for God as well- seeing as we accept the existence of the word, the concept, and can identify qualities depending on a specific belief (ie omnipotence, omnipresence). But therein lies the problem- what are the qualities that we choose? And we are back to the beginning.

P.S. As an atheist perhaps I just should have said "NO." :)
