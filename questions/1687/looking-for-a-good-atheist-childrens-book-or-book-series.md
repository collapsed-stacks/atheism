Hey I was thinking something along the lines of [His Dark Materials][1] or something similar. While not exactly "atheist" explicitly had some pretty awesome themes relating to religion and control. While it is definitely not something for the younger kids but, probably good for the "[Young Adult][2]". But if you have any recommendations for children of an earlier age by all means please post. 

Edit:
So I'm looking for young adult (that is approx 10 and up) but, if you have something that is possibly earlier but relevant than post away.

I hated that series. Such a promising start, and then downhill for every successive book. The third book was extraordinarily irritating, and it always surprises me when someone says, "It's not overtly anti-religious!" That's like saying the *Chronicles of Narnia* isn't overtly religious. Just because it conforms to your confirmation bias, doesn't mean it's neutral.

There is a certain point below which you can't really expect a kid to think critically about *anything* more less something as weird and fuzzy as religion. If you want to teach *critical* thought, read them creation myths from other cultures, so when they come across the ones from *our* culture, then they'll have a framework to deal with them. I tend to like Native American stuff and Greek myths.

Ancient Greek Myths, and Harry Potter series. I know those have a lot of gods and magic, but sure the interesting reading for a young atheist :)

Assuming you are talking about old enough to read. Not just picture books. The best material would be material that is for young adults. Children are not stupid. And if you read the book with them, and explain the words they do not understand, it will become a fine foundation to ground reality in.

This is what my own parents did with me.

However, they also didn't tell me they were Atheists until much later in life. They let me reach that position on my own. I even went through all the training to have my Bar Mitzvah.

In short. I wouldn't worry too much. Kids believe in Santa. And they grow out of it.

"The Greek Gods" by Evslin & Hoopes, for much the reason Satanic Puppy mentions.

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0061433039" rel="nofollow">"Nation" by Terry Pratchett</a></p>

<p>Amazing writing as usual, and some very pro-skeptism/science themes.</p>

I just saw a relatively new post on PZ Myers' [Pharyngula blog](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/) about a new children book called [Evolution: The Story of Life on Earth](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/evolution_the_story_of_life_on.php).

I personally haven't read it, but there is a free preview and that I did read. It's about evolution and not atheism per se, but I think it seems like a good, rational, fun and godless educating piece for kids.

To quote his blog post:

>Have you got kids? Are you tangentially related to any young people? Are you young yourself? Do you know anyone who just likes a good story and interesting science?

>Well, then, I'm sorry, but reading this article will cost you $12.89. Jay Hosler has a new book out (illustrated by Kevin Cannon and Zander Cannon), Evolution: The Story of Life on Earth(amzn/b&n/abe/pwll), and I'm afraid it's going to be required reading for everyone, and you're also all probably going to end up buying multiple copies for gifts.

>Really, it's that good. It's a comic book about aliens from Glargalia explaining the history of life on earth to young Prince Floorsh by going over the fundamental concepts and hitting a few of the details. It's entertaining and fun, and sneakily informative.

>If you don't simply trust me, check out the extensive excerpts at the [NCSE](http://ncse.com/news/2010/12/evolution-story-life-earth-006379) and at [Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=evolution-the-story-of-life-on-earth).

>Hey, and if you don't like comic books, don't know any young people, and don't want to read it yourself, buy a copy anyway and give it to your local library. For America.
