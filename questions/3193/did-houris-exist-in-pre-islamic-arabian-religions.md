Did houris (72 virgins) exist in any pre-Islamic religions in Arabia?

**Background:** In response to [What are debate points that can be used to debunk the 72 virgins argument?](http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2682/what-are-debate-points-that-can-be-used-to-debunk-the-72-virgins-argument), I'm thinking that if houris originated from religions Muslims regard as pagan, that'd be one way to debunk it.
