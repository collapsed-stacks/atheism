As many US readers will know, the US constitution offers special protection for religious practise, but why is this really necessary? 

That last sentence may have already set some fires burning, so let me qualify a little.

If I have the right to free speech, I want to tell my blog readers that God is great, what is that other than me excising that freedom ?

If I have the right to free assembly, why would gathering like minded individuals in a hall to chat nonsense (like a church for instance) not be protected by that right?

What are the benefits and drawbacks of specifically mentioning and protecting the right to practise religion?

Edit:
Isn't the fact that it is impossible to define what is a religion and what is a shared revelation problematic ?
