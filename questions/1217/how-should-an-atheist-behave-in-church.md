There are some occasions (weddings/funerals) where even atheists will want to go to church because people close to them are "affected" by the ceremony.

What do you think are some guidelines to follow, whereby you can stay true to your own convictions, but also not be a jerk and hurt other people feelings and beliefs. 

* Do you stand/sit/kneel when told to do so?

* Do you sing along with the church songs? Do you just move your lips as if singing?

* During prayers: Do you fold your hands and pretend to be also praying?

* In catholic church: Do you refuse communion bread? Even if it's offered to you directly?
