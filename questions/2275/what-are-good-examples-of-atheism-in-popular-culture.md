There is a Wikipedia <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Atheism_in_popular_culture>Category dedicated to atheism in popular culture</a>.  It's an interesting collection of noteworthy fictional atheists, comic books, references to billboards and bus campaigns, as well as a few select episodes of the television shows South Park and Family Guy.  The only movie mentioned is The Invention of Lying.  Music and books are completely unrepresented in this category.

I am therefore asking, what is missing from this category?  I would think that the first and foremost missing entry is the song "Imagine," by John Lennon.  But what else?
