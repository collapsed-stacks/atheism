There is a Wikipedia <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Atheism_in_popular_culture>Category dedicated to atheism in popular culture</a>.  It's an interesting collection of noteworthy fictional atheists, comic books, references to billboards and bus campaigns, as well as a few select episodes of the television shows South Park and Family Guy.  The only movie mentioned is The Invention of Lying.  Music and books are completely unrepresented in this category.

I am therefore asking, what is missing from this category?  I would think that the first and foremost missing entry is the song "Imagine," by John Lennon.  But what else?

**TV**

 - The Big Bang Theory - At least one main character (Sheldon) is an atheist. The others at a minimum do not follow the tenants of their religions.
 - The Mentalist - main character is an atheist
 - House - The title character is an atheist
 - Lie to Me - main character is an atheist

**Comedy -** 
There are lots of atheist comedians, but here are a few I like.

 - George Carlin
 - Sarah Silverman
 - Bill Maher

**Music -**
There are also tons of atheists in music. Of course they're all over the place in heavy metal and punk, but also in less confrontational genres. Wikipedia also already has a page listing atheist musicians. But here are a couple of fairly mainstream or mainstream sounding songs:

 - "Dear God" - XTC
 - "Deus" - Sugarcubes (Bjork's old band)
 - "God" - Tori Amos
 - "God" - John Lennon

I think comedy is often a source of atheism. Comedy is often about challenging authority or establishment. With that in mind two things struck me:

- Life of Brian - full of easily lead people clinging on to belief but also has aliens for good measure

- Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy books - full of parodies of god "disappearing in a puff of his own logic" etc

I am sure there are many more that aren't expressly atheist, but only thinly veiled.

The new show "Parenthood" just had an episode where a bird died and the parents struggled with what to say to their kid. They are not religious, but the mother broke down and said the bird went to heaven because she couldn't figure out what else to say. The father bit his lip. That was the end of the episode last Tuesday. I haven't been watching the show, but I might tune in just for that.

<p>Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth from <em>Futurama</em> !</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4DkOM.jpg" alt="Farnsworth"></p>

<p>Just watch a very positive and funny episode <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Origin" rel="nofollow">"A Clockwork Origin"</a>, where he finds himself arguing against anti-evolution protesters at Cubert's school. The latter hold belief in "Creaturism".</p>

Luke, one of the characters in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_One">"Player One" by Douglas Coupland</a> is a recalcitrant atheist. He is an ex-priest who lost his faith, and the whole story in the book is quite related to the notion of losing one's faith.

Very cool as most of Coupland's work.

(Note. I have deleted my previous answers because, as a few people mentioned, Dr. Gregory House is already in the list. My apologies)

Janis Joplin's song **Mercedes Benz** 

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz.
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends;
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends.
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz.

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV.
Dealing for dollars is trying to find me.
I wait for delivery each day until three.
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV.

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town.
I'm counting on you, Lord, please don't let me down.
Prove that you love me and buy the next round.
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on the town.

Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz.
My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends;
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends.
So Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz.
