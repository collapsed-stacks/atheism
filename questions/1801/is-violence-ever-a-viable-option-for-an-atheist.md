There are at least three societies when it comes to studying the treatment of atheists:

1.  Sweden.  People generally don't care whether you are one or not.

2.  US.  Atheism is growing (at least measured indirectly) but atheists are treated scornfully, and since the fundagelism is gaining at the same time (less theists, but the ones that exist, are increasingly more virulent), politicians either distance themselves with a token acknowledgment or condemn it, but never really support it in the slightest.  Society prefers atheists to remain rather closeted.

3. Saudi Arabia.  Atheism is a crime.  Atheist are dealt with violently, and society prefers that they do not exist.


Given that under 3., your only option is to remain closeted and die the only life you have, as a lie, why shouldn't violence be considered?  The worst that happens to you is that you die.  After physical torture.  But if you fight, generations down the road may benefit just like blacks do in the US after the Civil war violence over slavery.  

No war has been won by one side offering non-violence in response to violence. 

1. and 2. seem benign enough, probably what we do is sufficient.  

But what if trends reverse?  Fundagelicals get to dictate how atheists should live, incrementally.  The moderate majority goes with it, and soon you find yourself empathizing with the Saudi atheist.  An atheist car is vandalized, another's home set on fire, a couple beaten up, etc. with increasing frequency.  Is there some point you'd resort to violence? What if you cannot move to Sweden? 

Ask yourself if the Jews that survived the Holocaust would have survived if Hitler's violence was met with pacifism (or anything other than violence)?  Ask yourself if the death toll would have been different if there was more violent resistance, early on?

Note:

1. I did not advocate violence (here), nor did I specify how much or how little violence is justified. I asked for your considered view point. Admittedly, I did lean towards one answer more than the other in my presentation.

2. Violence does not always succeed.  Yes, I know this.  So unless you are making the case that violence always fails, please save yourself the trouble.

3. If you are unclear about what a word means, please feel free to assume that it is the primary or secondary meaning listed in Merriam Webster's

4. I am assuming that this is the only life you have.
