Arguing with friends it seems as if I have all the answers but Christians and Muslims feel the same way. I don't want to "win" as a better "debater"; I want to win because of the truth. 

What is it about the "human condition" makes each individual feel superior? What endows us with the certainty that we have the answers? How can I know the difference between opinion and "science," or what I refer to as "the facts"?
