Arguing with friends it seems as if I have all the answers but Christians and Muslims feel the same way. I don't want to "win" as a better "debater"; I want to win because of the truth. 

What is it about the "human condition" makes each individual feel superior? What endows us with the certainty that we have the answers? How can I know the difference between opinion and "science," or what I refer to as "the facts"?

Interesting question - But is it about Atheism?

I'd assert that it is human nature to want to / try to be on the 'winning' side.  It's also human nature to want to be right.  For example many, many people will habitually carry on an argument from their side even when it's clear that they're wrong.  Why? Because humans don't want to be wrong, ever.

Even wanting to win is wanting others to lose.  

As to science?  By its nature it is 'inhuman', in that being right or wrong don't matter in the least, emotion and effort don't matter either.  There's simply what is so, and whether or not your model of what is so is a working model or a more correct model.  That's a huge part (I think) of why science is so much an anathema to many people.  They simply don't find it to fit their model of win/lose and emotional humanity.

I think beleif sometimes clouds reason ... if someone doesn't take off the cap of programmed dogma ....He is bound to argue in a particular direction. With all arguments , it is not about truth , who ever argues correctly is always right.
