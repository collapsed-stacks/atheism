Recently I asked a friend if he was an atheist, he replied he wasn't. I asked him if he believed in god, and he said he didn't. I told him that this means he's an atheist, since an atheist simply means someone who doesn't believe in a god, but he told me that atheist means someone who is actively against religion, not someone who is indifferent to religion even if he doesn't believe in a god.

Similarly, I've seen that some people don't want to call Australian PM Julia Gillard an atheist, although she has clearly said that she doesn't believe in a god.

What does this mean? What's the real meaning of being an atheist? And why do people so often automatically assume that being an atheist means you must be anti religion?
