Self explanatory I hope, but to meet the necessary criteria: How can governments legitimately claim the authority to engage in the definition and regulation of cultural activity in a pluralistic society?

For example:

 1. Marriage
 2. Euthanasia
 3. Under God
 4. Equal weight to creationism
 5. Abortion
 6. Appropriate language in public.
 7. ...

They should have no part in cultural norms. Let's take marriage, for example. There is no secular reason to restrict marriage to a single man and a single woman. Homosexuality, polygamy and other odd (consenting) relationships should be treated equally.

If government is allowed to regulate and control this sort of thing, the only possibility is restricting people's rights, not protecting them, which is a violation of the point of a government to begin with.
