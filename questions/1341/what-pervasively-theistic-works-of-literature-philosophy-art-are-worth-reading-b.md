Some may be inclined to answer with a resounding "none." This is a perfectly valid and reasonable answer, however a *tremendous* amount of literature, philosophy and human history is strongly motivated by a religious agenda. It's probably worth thinking carefully before casually dismissing so much shared human history and creativity...
