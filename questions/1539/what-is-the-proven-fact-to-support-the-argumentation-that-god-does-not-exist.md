I am an agnostic because I have no enough information whether or not God or Alien really exist. 

For me, I just need to do humanistic activities and if god really exist,  she/he must be a wise object. She/he will not judge me based on whether or not I believe him/her.


I think both atheists or god believers have no proof. :-)
