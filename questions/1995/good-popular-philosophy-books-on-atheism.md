I get often asked by friends and relatives what atheism is and what is it all about.

What good, friendly, non-aggressive books are available to explain our position to the typical theist or agnostic person? They should be written for the non-philosopher, so easy to read, but engaging and deep.

List only one book per answer. Upvote the each book you think is worthwhile.

Would you consider "The Demon-Haunted World" by Sagan?  The book explains the scientific method and skeptical thinking quite well, which would apply to non-belief.

There is [the intelligent person's guide to atheism by Daniel Harbour](http://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Persons-Guide-Atheism-Guides/dp/0715629158). Nice though a bit pedantic and repetitive.

In french and [spanish](http://www.carloscapote.com/critica/cursoaceleradoateismo/), there is [Cours accéléré d'athéisme](http://www.decitre.fr/livres/Cours-accelere-d-atheisme.aspx/9782930390048) by Campillo and Ferraras. Very light and humorous but adresses the key points for an understanding of atheism.

There is the [Cambridge companion to atheism](http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Companion-Atheism-Companions-Philosophy/dp/0521603676) which does not solely focus on the philosophical aspects though. I didn't really enjoy it either.

I'm already reading The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. So far its good.
