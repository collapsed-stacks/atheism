I get often asked by friends and relatives what atheism is and what is it all about.

What good, friendly, non-aggressive books are available to explain our position to the typical theist or agnostic person? They should be written for the non-philosopher, so easy to read, but engaging and deep.

List only one book per answer. Upvote the each book you think is worthwhile.
