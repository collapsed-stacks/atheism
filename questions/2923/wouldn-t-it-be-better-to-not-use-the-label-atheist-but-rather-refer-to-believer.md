## Wouldn't it be better to not use the label Atheist, but rather refer to believers as Theists?

What benefits are there to not self-identifying as Atheist; and instead insisting on referring to believers as Theists?

The descriptive word 'Atheist' is broadly applied, I would even consider myself one, but I hate being labeled as I'm sure anyone does. However, I haven't done or not done anything, when someone asks me if I'm an atheist, I usually reply, you're the theist.

It seems meaningless to be labeled as an Atheist; I'm not militant, nor even advocating for it very aggressively. Why should those who don't believe in the supernatural be labeled anything? Isn't it more meaningful to label those who make claims, rather than those who do not?
