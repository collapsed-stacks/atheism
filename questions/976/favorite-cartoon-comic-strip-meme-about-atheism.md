As I surf the net, I find hundreds of comics and memes about atheism and disbelief in God.

Has anybody gone through any such meme and would like to share with the community?

Like I have one here:

<p>Russell's Teapot was always a favourite strip of mine.  Unfortunately the original site is no more, but a few of the comics are archived <a href="http://www.freethunk.net/russells-teapot/comics-russells-teapot.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is my all time favourite:</p>

My favorite heathen meme is probably baby-eating. What self respecting atheist doesn't love the taste of babies?

Oh boy - there are so many! Carlin, of course, and Penn & Teller. There's a fabulous clip on YouTube of Ricky Gervais talking about Genesis, and also one of Dara O'Briain on homeopathy. And Richard Ince on Creationism ("A magic man did it.")

Bill Maher.  HBO's Real Time and his stand up one-man shows.  George Carlin.  Don't ask God for anything.  Ask Joe Pesci 'cos 'he looks like a guy that can get things done'.
