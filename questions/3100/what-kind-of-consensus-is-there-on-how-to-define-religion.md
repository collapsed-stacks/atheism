Many of the questions here use the word "religion," but I'm not sure there is an agreed upon definition of what "religion" means.

Is there such a defintion? If not, would you like to put yours forth so that we can come to some kind of tentative agreement?

One of the reasons I ask this is because of the casual way the word *"religion"* and *"religious"* can get used in everyday speech. For instance, I heard someone make the comment: *"He works out religiously."* meaning that that someone works out regularly and habitually. For obvious reasons, I'm not sure that this use of *"religion"* applies here.

Nonetheless, in sustaining a dialog on any topic it is necessary to be speaking the same language so that we aren't talking past each other. In furthering this interest and being able to more reliably answer questions, when we speak of religion, what specifically are we speaking of and how does that definition come about?
