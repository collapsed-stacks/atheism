I am interested in documenting the Bible stories that show that the Bible cannot and should not be taken literally. What particular resources exist that document the various contradictions, absurdities, or grotesque acts of the Bible?

My "go-to" unbelievable stories are those that should be reflected in outside historic documentation but aren't. Among these, my favorites are:

* Noah's flood ended all human civilization yet Egyptians maintained a flourishing, document-generating culture. Did someone forgot to tell them they'd all drowned?
* God made the sun stand still for Joshua at the battle of Jericho. Not a single astronomer in any of a number of advanced and literate societies bothered to remark on the event. Something similar could be said of the Star of Bethlehem.
* 500 people saw Jesus after his resurrection; not a single mention in contemporary blogs.
* Thousands of zombies roamed the streets of Jerusalem when Jesus rose from the grave. Local chronists, though, apparently had more interesting things to document.

I'm personally partial to the story of Lot's daughters after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  (And after Lot's wife had turned to a pillar of salt.)

Lot and his daughters didn't know if there was anyone else left alive on earth and, the girls worried that this could mean the end of the human race.  So they conspired to:

1.  Get their father drunk enough to pass out
2.  Rape him
3.  Get pregnant

They both succeeded and essentially bore his grandchildren.  

If Lot shared his daughter's concerns for the continuity of the human race, why did they have to do it secretly?  Even if they were all put-off by the idea, they would have to at least agree that it was their only option ... at least if they were certain that there weren't any other living humans.  And if they were put off by it, maybe it would've been prudent to try and find out before jumping into the drunken rape/incest thing...

The Skeptics Annotated Bible is my favourite Internet source:
http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/

Here's a trick I learned many decades ago: Pop into your local Christian bookshop and buy something like The Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties by Gleason Archer, or Alleged Discrepancies of the Bible by John Haley. These books have all the "difficult" verses clearly listed, along with the most popular explanations that Christians will use in their debates with atheists.

But don't stop there. Now that you know which verses most Christians will use to explain a Bible difficulty, head back to the Skeptics Annotated Bible and find even more verses that contradict those which the Apologist is using as explanations for the original difficulty.

The routine goes like this: 

 - You mention a Bible difficulty
 - The Christian counters with one of
   the currently popular explanations.
 - Now you bring in the new verse that
   contradicts the verse used by the
   Christian.

It may happen that the Christian has an explanation for this "new" problem, but it is too late - this new problem has already destroyed the Christian's explanation for the original difficulty.

OK, not as easy as it sounds, but worth a try.

<p>I am currently reading
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Hates-Hate-Back-ebook/dp/B0037Z70H6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=APZETQFSWU1YM&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1294905734&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">"God Hates You, Hate Him Back: Making Sense of The Bible"</a></p>

<p>It lists inconcistencies in the Bible with humour<br>
You may prefer a more serious book as it may seeems a little bit light</p>
