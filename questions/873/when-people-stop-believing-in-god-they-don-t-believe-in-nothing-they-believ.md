This quote is by GK Chesterton. Is he right? In my experience, it is xians who tend to beleive in "anything" - ghosts, astrology, alt-med. I recall that there was actually a piece of research in the USofA which demonstrated that they are more vulnerable to financial scammers. It's probably making a virtue of believing without evidence which causes it - not being able to understand the nature of evidence, and refusing to acknowledge how easily their own brain can be tricked. It's what makes even quite mild, liberal religion dangerous.
