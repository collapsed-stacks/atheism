When theists claim "homosexuality" is a learned behavior, and an abomination, that can be either 

* unlearned -- [further addressed with this question](http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/1018/reorientation-of-homosexuals)
* or, tamed

how do you go about addressing them? Assume for the purposes of this argument that the theists:

* believe god uses evolution as a tool
* believe that a man is not born homosexual (not apart of his identity)
* god has created man outside of the realm of animals
* homosexuality isn't an abomination in other non-human animals
* god gave us the the ability, through him of course, to combat homosexual tendencies
