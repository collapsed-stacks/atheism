I'm torn on what to say - part of me is irritated that they assume that I am a Christian, so I want to reply "Happy Solstice" or "Happy Hanukkah" to them in return to make them realize that not everyone celebrates Christmas, but I realize that most of them are saying it in innocence and without an agenda and I don't want to spoil their mood.  Still, there are those that do have an agenda, i.e. pushing their stupid religion, and that really irritates me.  So I usually end up saying "you too" or something inane like that.  How do you handle it?
