I wonder what actually is Christianity:

1) After the death of Jesus his followers were 100% Jewish. They had the same traditions, Sabbath and circumvention. Only during the first concilie 40 years later they decided to stop circumvention and sabbath. Meaning: everything afterwards is not core Christianity.

2) Presumably the thing left is that a "soul" had to be freed from eternal sin because during Adam and Eve we acquired eternal sin, problem is that "soul", the core concept left, is not defined in the bible (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul) while it is in Egyptian Religions (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_soul). And as you can in the listings about every Christian group thinks something else "you are gone like dust" versus "your soul leaves your body and goes to live forever" (all made up later and no christian has the same opinion).

3) Sacrificing a God to gain immortality is also a thought there at least since Osiris (because before that people killed their family and ate them to gain special powers whereafter 7000 years ago they virtually killed people, gods, to gain special powers)

4) older jewish influences (5 books) like 10 commandments come from the Egyptian book of Death or come straight from the older Pyramid texts like "eat my flesh drink my blood" (because they WERE cannibals when they left the stone age to start their civiliation).

5) And even Maria is now pretty proven to be Isis worshipping. (many images from isis and child where literally overpainted to be Maria and child) (and churches were build on top of Isis temples) (like the Notre Dame in Paris "near temple of Isis" where they worshipped Isis until the 18th century).

6) Etc...

All things later are management decisions. 

Is it me or am I missing something, I have no clue what Christians believe in other than the same words / concepts as in the Egyptian Religion, which IS traceable to natural events depicted in deities starting from the stone ages.
