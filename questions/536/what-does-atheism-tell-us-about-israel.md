I have a touchy question: How should our atheism inform our opinions towards middle east peace?

Let me explain a bit: I'm an atheist, and I'm not American, but I do live in the United States, where unconditional support for Israel is basically the only politically acceptable position in polite company.  And I certainly am not an anti-semite, nor do I deny that Jewish people should be able to live in peace wherever they want or defend themselves from attack.

But the conflict in the middle east is based on two conflicting religions believing that they have a divine mandate to occupy a certain portion of land.  No matter what holy book such divine claims come from, I reject them as an atheist, so I don't respect the claims of either side that they **must** retain Jerusalem, for example.

So what is the logically consistent position for atheists, and rationalists in general, to take on middle east peace?
