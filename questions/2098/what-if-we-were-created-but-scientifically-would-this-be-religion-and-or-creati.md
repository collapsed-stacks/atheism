What if we were created by a more intelligent beings, using science rather than magic? After all, we were able to create a [mini big bang][1] ourselves. 

If our universe's big bang were created by some other beings and they were thus *our creators*, would this be considered religion, creationism, or something else?

<p>It would be science. Science deals with observable data and everything you have described is (in principle) observable. It would not be religion/creationism because it doesn't add any new knowledge. Big Bang is still Big Bang, evolution is still evolution, God(s) are still unnecessary. In fact, assuming our 'creators' have no way interact with our universe, nothing would change at all. It only shifts the question to - where did that universe come from?</p>

<p>There’s a slightly different but related argument that I find very compelling, called the <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/" rel="nofollow">simulation argument</a>.</p>

<p>The argument basically states that with a certain high probability,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we are […] living in a computer simulation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t state the argument here in its entirety) (read the original paper as <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html" rel="nofollow">HTML</a> or <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a> – it’s quite short and well-written). Suffice to say that there is no way for us to “pierce” the simulation and (unless the programmers have left flaws or hints for us to find) we cannot verify whether this is true. And <em>more importantly</em>, we cannot, <em>in principle</em>, verify that this hypothesis is false.</p>

<p>So <strong>this theory fails falsifiability and thus isn’t science</strong>. That doesn’t mean that it’s false, though. Merely that we can’t tell one way or another, and (probably) that it doesn’t matter, except metaphysically. It’s the <a href="http://godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm" rel="nofollow">invisible dragon in the garage</a>, with the one exception that it’s much more plausible.</p>

<p>I find this intellectually unsatisfactory in the extreme but that’s just the way it is.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call the above “religion”, nor even “belief” (people don’t believe that it’s true, merely that it’s a serious possibility, which is, by the way, vastly more likely than all religious creation myths). <strong>It would <em>become</em> religion if people let this possibility influence their lives</strong> or deduce moral law from it.</p>

<p>It would be begging the question: Who created the creators? And the answer would still remain: no one. They evolved.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter how you suppose a creator created us- it's still religion because there is still absolutely no proof and so it still requires faith to believe it in the first place.  Two more important points: any being so powerful it could have deliberately created us is in effect a god from our perspective.  And anything that actually happened, whether the result of a primal god-force or an evolved being, would be by definition 'real', and thus subject to the laws of reality, whatever they happen to be.  So from our perspective there is really no important distinction between a hyper-evolved alien species that created us and a god that did so- both would be so powerful in relation to us that we couldn't resist anything they would want to impose upon us, and both would ultimately fall within the laws of the physical universe, though we might not now understand those laws.  </p>

<p>How could a rational, intelligent entity wrap religion around something that was "created scientifically"?</p>

<p>Hence, it could not possibly be religion but it would be creationism, the type of creationism however, that has nothing in common with delusional nonsense which is currently regarded as creationsim.</p>

<p>Well, science prof that there is a God. let's suppose that you have 1 billion chemical elements what is the probability to have randomly a cell. and what is the probability to have randomly water, and even if you have a cell how did that cell know that it must reproduce, and in order to reproduce it should have a DNA strand and with only 4 elements (A,G,C and T) it can describe it self, and how about the first cell that existed? it died for sure because it didn't have all these "knowledge". 
I am a computer scientist and we computer science people and electricians are striving to find a mechanism that enables us to have a powerful and intelligent machines you can say we are trying to imitate human being. The human being brain is far most developed than the first cells and we couldn't figure out a way to make it, Turing deducted after many years that we can use 1 and 0 to describe any kind of information and it was like a big revolution so it turned out that the first cell is far more intelligent than Turing with his Turing machine and far more intelligent than all the human being living now on the planet.
This is only for a cell, if we take a look at the complex species it will be a mess.
How did those species through the evolution principle know that they need a blood to transport food and withe cells to protect to body if there is any intrusion and a stomach to process the food and in order to make the blood run they need a kind of pump so they created the heart, and the question for the cells was how should the food be transformed? to witch kind of energy?, the decision was made on ATP and then the other question was how to control the body?, the answer was easy! create a brain and a nervous system and it is done and we can go in this was so far.
I mean how did cells know that we need teeth and a tongue, you know some times we need to eat some hard things some it need to be per-processed and then passed to the stomach.
How did know that we need eyes and ears, I  means how did they figure that sound exists and did they decide that we need to see.
And if I continue it will be about hundred pages.</p>
