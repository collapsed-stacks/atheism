In general, I think that Atheists are more educated about Religion. If nothing else, we know enough about enough faiths to have realized they are all pretty much the same thing. But should this be the case?

**Is Religious Education a prerequisite for being capable to argue in favor of Atheism?**

But more philosophically in addition to that, is it wise to be well educated about religion? Does it make you a better Atheist?
