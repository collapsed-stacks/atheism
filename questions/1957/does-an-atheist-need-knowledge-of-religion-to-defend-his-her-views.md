In general, I think that Atheists are more educated about Religion. If nothing else, we know enough about enough faiths to have realized they are all pretty much the same thing. But should this be the case?

**Is Religious Education a prerequisite for being capable to argue in favor of Atheism?**

But more philosophically in addition to that, is it wise to be well educated about religion? Does it make you a better Atheist?

<p>You don't need to any knowledge of religion to be able to defend atheism. All that you need is a good epistemology. When presented with a supernatural claim such as the existence of a god, you only get to ask what are the evidence and judge them without using <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Anti-Epistemology" rel="nofollow">bad epistemology</a>.</p>

<p>To put it another way, you don't need knowledge of the religion behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot" rel="nofollow">Russel's teapot</a> or <a href="http://godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Dragon.htm" rel="nofollow">the dragon in my garage</a> to justify your non-belief in them. It would require <em>faith</em> and that is not a justified belief.</p>

I think it's critical for forming an educated opinion. I've known a lot of atheists that were as spooked and horrified when confronted with religion as religious people tend to be when confronted with atheism.

Additionally, if you're ever called upon to defend your lack of faith, it's extremely helpful to understand the religious point of view, so you can structure your arguments in a way that will make sense to them.

Finally, I think that if you never test your own beliefs, then they're not very strong. In my experience, people who categorically refuse to admit that there is even anything to *talk* about with regard to the god/no god thing, have the very most fragile beliefs.

<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>I believe demanding religious knowledge before a person is allowed to stake a pro-atheism position, amounts to what PZ Myers calls <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/the_courtiers_reply.php" rel="nofollow">"The Courtier's Reply."</a></p>

<p>PZ did such a good job with this one that I won't belabor his points, but only offer a couple (hopefully) pithy comments:</p>

<p>First, you don't have to be a tailor to tell the Emperor has no clothes.
Second, you don't have to be a chef to recognize that there is something "off" about the meal you've been force-fed since birth. </p>

It basically amount to "Is knowing why you believe what you believe the most rational position to hold?" I think that's a question that answers itself. Yes, of course.
