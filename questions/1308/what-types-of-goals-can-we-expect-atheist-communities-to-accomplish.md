It seems there is great variation within the atheist community, as there is in any community. 

I wonder, are there any goals that everyone or at least everyone in an atheist community might agree on, or are atheists too diverse to unify in their a common goal. Are the goals that can be agreed on unique to atheists or are they more generally secularist in intention? What makes an atheist goal as opposed to a secularist goal?

Obviously, this community has formed with the purpose of answering questions about atheism, so I suppose I mean beyond that, for which goals can we get wide consensus?
