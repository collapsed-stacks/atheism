To paraphrase American philosopher/psychologist William James: better to keep our minds open on the question of religion because we don't know if such a relationship will benefit us until we have entered into it. While I know that there are deconverts and etc, I wonder more generally about the consequences of forming and not forming a position. 

Besides the logical side to atheism, there is apparently an emotional side as well (evident from strong anti-religious sentiments I've seen expressed on this site.) How do we judge this emotional side? Do we refute this *religious hypothesis* or have we applied it and felt wronged? Did at one point we attempt to enter this relationship and fail?  Or is it anger due to an empathy for fellow man who we may perceive as being harmed by this relationship?  

I, myself, attempted many a time to enter into this relationship, and failed- which did give me some negative emotions- that were mostly cured when fully accepted my atheism. But, and to turn this into a proper question, as atheism is also personal and emotional- are the negative reactions to religion a necessary part of it? Are they a form of proselytizing?
