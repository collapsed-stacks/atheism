To paraphrase American philosopher/psychologist William James: better to keep our minds open on the question of religion because we don't know if such a relationship will benefit us until we have entered into it. While I know that there are deconverts and etc, I wonder more generally about the consequences of forming and not forming a position. 

Besides the logical side to atheism, there is apparently an emotional side as well (evident from strong anti-religious sentiments I've seen expressed on this site.) How do we judge this emotional side? Do we refute this *religious hypothesis* or have we applied it and felt wronged? Did at one point we attempt to enter this relationship and fail?  Or is it anger due to an empathy for fellow man who we may perceive as being harmed by this relationship?  

I, myself, attempted many a time to enter into this relationship, and failed- which did give me some negative emotions- that were mostly cured when fully accepted my atheism. But, and to turn this into a proper question, as atheism is also personal and emotional- are the negative reactions to religion a necessary part of it? Are they a form of proselytizing?

I have never been a theist. I have never practiced any religion. I am an atheist. I am not having a negative reaction to something I once felt or embraced, or tried to feel or embrace and failed. 

YMMV, of course. Some people do arrive at atheism after having been a theist. I'm not one of them.

Any argument for anything can be illogical and based on emotions or can be stated emotionally. Some things atheists say are logically sound and some things are not. Replace the word "atheist" with any other group of people and the statement is still true. Saying that "atheism" is a negative reaction to religion is the same type of category mistake that is made when someone says that "religion" is evil. They are both things that can't have those properties.

So, no, it isn't that because it can't be that. Someone could choose to be atheist to get back at their mean mother, but that doesn't change what atheism is.

I have the same reaction to religion that I have to criminality.  It's an unethical waste of precious human talent, and it survives by leeching off of good people.  Religions are cons, and religious leaders are con-men.  They feed on the weak and stupid to fill their own pockets and ego through intimidation, fear, abuse, and violence.

It is not that I am simply annoyed, bothered, or frustrated by religions and religious leaders, I am angry.  These institutions and people are engaged in a criminal deceit and fraud as well as other crimes.

I have a negative reaction because it is the logical reaction to have in the face of such unethical and exploitative behavior.

There's several possible sources for anti-religious feelings that are not specific to atheism.

Some atheists just feel like the theists are picking on them, often with very good reason.  If people despise what I think, I'm likely to despise what they think.

Some atheists are converts from religion, and were raised in a religion.  This means that they sometimes feel betrayed by birth, and sometimes just have the fervor of a convert (talk to some people who've managed to quit smoking, for example).

Some people are just angry at large organizations that profit from what they see as other people's irrational beliefs, and have influence over society in ways that the atheist doesn't like.

Some people just dislike irrational thinking, and take exception to other people believing things with no good reason.
