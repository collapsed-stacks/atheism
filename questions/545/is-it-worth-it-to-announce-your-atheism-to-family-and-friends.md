It doesn't come up too often, but I've found that when a friend has asked what religion I ascribe to, I've answered "Nothing, I'm an Atheist."  Then comes the questions, which usually leads to incredulity, then sometimes a difference in how I'm treated.

My family is very religious (Christian/Catholic) and I've felt that's its not even worth the time/effort to state my position on the matter.  I'm also fearful of getting treating like I've ruined the family's name.

Has announcing your atheism to family and friends been worth these potential issues?  How did you do it?
