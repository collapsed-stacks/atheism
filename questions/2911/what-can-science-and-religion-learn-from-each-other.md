Both science and religions have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to captivating people's attention and providing answers to important questions. Each camp goes about resolving these issues in a different way and each is coming up with quite impressive results.

 - What can scientists learn from religious leaders? What would the lesson be?

 - What can religion learn from science? What would the lesson be?

Richard Feynman's idea of "What I cannot create, I do not understand." comes to mind. Are there scientists creating credible religious movements with massive following to study its dynamics? (I do not talk about Flying Spaghetti Monster and similar pranks.) Are there religious leaders doing high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific research on God's existence (preferably using the LHC? ;) 

I would be interested in all evidence of genuine, honest and recent efforts in these two directions. I do not care so much about why is this not going to work - this prevalent opinion was already sufficiently covered.
