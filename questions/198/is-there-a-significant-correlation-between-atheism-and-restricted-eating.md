I have noticed a strong trend in my personal circle of friends that the vegetarians among us are all atheist, while my Christian friends don't think twice about eating animals.  In fact I have met other vegetarians through work across the US and we always end up talking about being atheist.  I don't expect a large number of atheists to be vegetarian/vegan, but I would like to know if there is a strong trend.

EDIT: I'm sure I'm addressing the wrong subset, `<assumption>` vegetarians are more likely to be atheist, but atheists are not more likely to vegetarian`</assumption>`.  But that lead to an interesting situation where we have a significant number of vegetarians among us, unless they are still a minority in a minority.

EDIT2: I didn't mean for this to turn into a poll, but I do appreciate all the responses.  I suppose any statistics for this particular issue are hard to come by.  Also, aside from India, I'm surprised so many people are more familiar with religious vegetarians.

I don't think this is true outside of America/Europe. India, for example, is both strongly religious and vegetarian. More details here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_and_religion

I would say there is no correlation. 
In the Netherlands we have for example the political Animal Party, who are against eating animals and they are run by a couple of fundamentalist Christians. 
In my circle of friends there are also quite a few Christians that tend to extend the "be good to your neighbor" to animals and they won't eat meat for that reason.

I can only answer for myself and for some of the meat-eating atheists I know, but I think the answer is no. Which makes me wonder though if the trend is not the other way around, i.e. that vegetarians tend to be atheists more often. I suspect though that the answer to that question would be no as well, since I can imagine there are a lot of newage types into vegetarianism.

I think the person who comes in with the hard data wins the prize! :D

I think it would be a loose correlation. I could see how being a free thinker could lead to a stronger understanding of animal conditions, and a lack of strict acceptance that our current consumption is a good path to go down... but I think that's probably a step farther than just atheism.

My wife and I are atheist and we are meet eaters.  I don't know any atheist personally that are vegetarians.  But I have always equated vegetarianism as a gateway to fascism since hitler was a vegetarian:D)

I would say that it probably just has to do with it being more socially acceptable to be an atheist amongst liberal circles. I don't know any vegetarian atheists. All the vegetarians I've known are Christian.

I think you'd find a stronger correlation to a hippy religion like Wicca than to Atheism. Your belief or lack of belief in a higher power is irrelevant to your craving for tasty flesh.

I'm a godless vegan, but I can only speak for myself!

<p>I feel as though you're grasping for straws. </p>

<p>There may be certain moral connections between some eating habits and some beliefs, but in reality, some of these things are just as hypocritical, for instance, <a href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2010/10/no-such-thing-as-a-vegan.jpg" rel="nofollow">being vegan</a>. </p>

I doubt there is a strong correlation, but I'm unaware of any study that supports or refutes the position.  I am an atheist carnivore.

Nope!  I don't have a mustache or drive a Volkswagen either!
