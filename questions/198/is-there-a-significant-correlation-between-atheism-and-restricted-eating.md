I have noticed a strong trend in my personal circle of friends that the vegetarians among us are all atheist, while my Christian friends don't think twice about eating animals.  In fact I have met other vegetarians through work across the US and we always end up talking about being atheist.  I don't expect a large number of atheists to be vegetarian/vegan, but I would like to know if there is a strong trend.

EDIT: I'm sure I'm addressing the wrong subset, `<assumption>` vegetarians are more likely to be atheist, but atheists are not more likely to vegetarian`</assumption>`.  But that lead to an interesting situation where we have a significant number of vegetarians among us, unless they are still a minority in a minority.

EDIT2: I didn't mean for this to turn into a poll, but I do appreciate all the responses.  I suppose any statistics for this particular issue are hard to come by.  Also, aside from India, I'm surprised so many people are more familiar with religious vegetarians.
