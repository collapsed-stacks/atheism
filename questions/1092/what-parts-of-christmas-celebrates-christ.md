Christians seem to think on December 25, everyone celebrates the birth of Jesus. Yet, when I tell them explicitly that it is expressly *not my desire* to celebrate *that*, I'm often confused by the advice I get. I do not want to celebrate Jesus at all during the Holidays. I want people to look at me, and my custom, and know that I'm certainly not thinking about Christ...

What parts of Christmas is the celebration of Christ? Don't tell me what I should do, what will Christians be doing, that I shouldn't be doing: I don't have a nativity set.
