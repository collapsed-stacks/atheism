I just asked [a question][1] about english language and I used God in my example. I do know that church believes that God is always good. Do you know any other examples when he was not good?

Christians might make the excuse that anything their god does it automatically good. The bible says otherwise where god claims to have created evil.

Isaiah 45:7

I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
