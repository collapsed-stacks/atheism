Some religions attempt to remove the self esteem of its followers, claiming that only through following their instructions can there be any hope. Also they use clever mind games to reinforce this. For example insisting that thinking about things is wrong but that with "faith" things will work out for the best. What parallels can be found between religion and abusive an relationships? Are there religions to which this does not apply?
