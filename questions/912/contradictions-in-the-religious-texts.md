In the Old Testament, within Genesis there are two creation stories that contradict each other so much so that many have said they are in fact two separate stories.

 - Genesis 1:25-27, Humans were created after the other animals. The first man and woman were created at the same time 
 - Genesis 2:18-19, Humans were created before the other animals. Adam was created first, then the animals, then Eve from Adam's rib.

Does anybody have any more interesting contradictions that the next religious doorstep caller can be hit with?
