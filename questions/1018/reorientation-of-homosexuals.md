Read this first: as the poster, I'm not interested in arguments from statistics, or arguments from science. Save that for another question. I'm interested in metaphorical, or  philosophical counter points to homosexual reorientation.

I find homosexual rights, and the status of homosexuals to be a hot issue when talking to Christians about morality. Today, I viewed online [Rabbi Shmuley vs Mr. Brown pt 1](http://www.shmuley.com/news/details/homosexuality_debate_with_dr.brown1/), in it Shmuley made a point regarding evangelicals opposition to homosexual marriage:

Background: Boteach isn't an atheist; he's a Jewish rabbi. However, he is debating a Christian on their home-turf, so I think we can give him props; and, I think his point and debate should be grounds for questioning here. 

> Because for all of you who think we should be sending them off to camps and reorienting them: I want to see if you're prepared to have that guy marry your daughter, after his reorientation. As long as you're prepared to say this guy this guy was completely gay and had no attraction to any women, now he went to camp for a year and he is cured. I want to see you marry him off to your daughter.
>
> -- Rabbi Shmuley Boteach

Well said Boteach! I think this has an interesting ability with regards to this issue:

* it exploits the evangelicals' homophobia
* it quickly highlights doubt of reorientation
* forces them to accept an ex-homosexual's marriage to their daughter, or to admit that reorientation-concept is a farce
 * now, the one exception I can think of is if the sin of homosexuality is so great, that even after reorientation the burden of the past is great enough to object to marriage.

Even though Mr. Brown affirmed he would accept a reoriented gay, I think the point was a powerful one. I, personally, doubt there was more than one or two others in his midst that would have made the same statement.

Shmuley is rather entertaining, he does a *great* job pushing points and winnings debates. He is easily one of the most amusing modern apologetics.

Are there any other great retorts to claims of homosexual reorientation, that don't involve science or statistics (because that evidence is overwhelming, and easily found).
