I am looking for data/statistics regarding the progression of Atheism/theism over the last century.

My personal 'feeling' is actually that Atheism is loosing terrain on world scale, but I don't have numbers to in/confirm this feeling.

Are there any resources, or studies over time on the religious/areligious adherence of people in the world?
