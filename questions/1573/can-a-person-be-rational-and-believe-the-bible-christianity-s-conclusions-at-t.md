I never studied the Bible myself, but from what I gather in atheist resources, it has numerous irrational and unreasonable conclusions, contradictions, and claims shown to be false.

Does this completely preclude a person striving to be always rational from following the Bible and christianity?

In other words, would a person properly adhering to christianity be necessarily acting irrationally on occasions?
