The Boy Scouts of America are an admittedly theist organization. They have "policies which prohibit atheists and agnostics from membership in its Scouting program, and prohibit 'avowed' homosexual people from leadership roles in its Scouting program as directly violating its fundamental principles and tenets." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America_membership_controversies">Wikipedia</a>) The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld this, declaring they are a private association and can choose not to allow non-theists and gays.

Many parents find the activities of the Boy Scouts &mdash; outdoor fun like hiking, camping, and rafting; group competitions like raingutter regatta or pine-box derby; the leadership training &mdash; to be positive things. The networking which occurs is as useful as it is in any fraternity, club, or military branch. 

But they won't let boys in if they don't profess a belief in a deity. (Or if they're gay, which I find equally objectionable but not the topic here.)

For parents who would like their sons to be able to do all the fun Scout things but find these policies untenable, is it better to boycott the BSA in particular and find non-Christian groups, or to join the Scouts and by being a member have a voice in changing the group's policies?
