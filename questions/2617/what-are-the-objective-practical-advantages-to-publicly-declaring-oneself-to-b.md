There are many objective, practical advantages to declaring oneself publicly as being a secular theist. Examples vary, depending on the local community and religion, but typically include (by no means an exhaustive list):

 * Standard social benefits associated with signaling membership to any large in-groups
 * Large support networks, which often allow for anonymous delivery and receipt of charity
 * Access to reduced cost, restricted-access, support resources, such as marital counselling, psychological support
 * Strong in-group support for family cohesiveness, and group pressure to maintain a stable unit


I often hear advantages such as these listed as good, rational reasons, to publicly adopt a theist stance and image, whether or not truly agreeing with it in private. Similarly, I often run into the view that closet-atheism is a much more practical approach to existence, than public-atheism would be.

Are there objective arguments that can be made to counter these points? What are the objective, practical advantages, to public declaration of one's Atheism? Are there any general advantages, or are they all tied to the specific environment that one lives in?
