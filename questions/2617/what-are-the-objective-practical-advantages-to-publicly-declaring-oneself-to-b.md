There are many objective, practical advantages to declaring oneself publicly as being a secular theist. Examples vary, depending on the local community and religion, but typically include (by no means an exhaustive list):

 * Standard social benefits associated with signaling membership to any large in-groups
 * Large support networks, which often allow for anonymous delivery and receipt of charity
 * Access to reduced cost, restricted-access, support resources, such as marital counselling, psychological support
 * Strong in-group support for family cohesiveness, and group pressure to maintain a stable unit


I often hear advantages such as these listed as good, rational reasons, to publicly adopt a theist stance and image, whether or not truly agreeing with it in private. Similarly, I often run into the view that closet-atheism is a much more practical approach to existence, than public-atheism would be.

Are there objective arguments that can be made to counter these points? What are the objective, practical advantages, to public declaration of one's Atheism? Are there any general advantages, or are they all tied to the specific environment that one lives in?

You stop lying to yourself and other about believing in a god or deity. This I consider the major advantage. Similar to reasons why gay people "come out of the closet". Honesty is always admired by others, and so you then understand who is your real friend, or who just liked you because of what they thought you should be.

<ul><li>When more people declare themselves to be atheists, publicly, it shows that the stereotype of the immoral atheist is wrong. We are just normal people. <li>It also emboldens others who are unsure of the social ramifications of being an atheist are not as bad as they might think. <li>It allows one to concentrate on what is important in life by not having to give lip-service to religious rituals. </ul>

I think you may be overestimating the value of being a theist. Unless you live in an overt theocracy, such as is common in the Muslim world, the benefits of being a public theist are tenuous at best. (And in those theocracies, being a member of any religion other than the official state religion is just as dangerous as being an atheist.)

While it is true that the benefits you cite are available to theists, there are comparable secular and humanist groups in which you can participate. The Internet is a great resource for finding those groups and starting your own if need be. 

Now it is true that in some cultures, people are taught that atheists are not to be trusted.  If you are lying and calling yourself a theist for the purposes of maintaining public appearances, you are not helping to rebut this perception.

Being free, to finally admit who you are. I have great Christian friends. However in New Zealand where I live its not such a big deal. I have no idea who knows I am an Atheist. If anyone asks me then I will tell them and if I lose that person as a friend then they were never really a friend.

Her is a great site for people who have come out after a religious upbringing.
