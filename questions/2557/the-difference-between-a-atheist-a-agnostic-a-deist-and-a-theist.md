How I see it:

<br>
<br>
**Atheist**

- rejects religious Gods because their attributes defy logic/nature
- admits the possibility of a creator, intelligent or not (other than religious Gods)

<br>
<br>
**Agnostic**

- admits the possibility of religious Gods, and/or the possibility of a (intelligent) creator

<br>
<br>
**Deist:**

- rejects the possibility of religious Gods (don't know why :)
- believes in the existence of a intelligent creator (other than religious Gods)

<br>
<br>
**Theist:**

- believes in the existence of a religious God
<br>
<br>

Is this correct? Some Christian friends of mine are arguing that I'm a agnostic or deist because I accept the possibility of a creator. Am I?

And are theists any different from deists?
