I've noticed that there is a wide selection of atheism apparel, but I can't find anything to clearly express my lack-of-religious views when it comes to a beanie - I think the British call them skull caps.. In fact the closest thing I can find is this styling [RDF hoodie](http://store.richarddawkins.net/products/limited-edition-rdf-navy-hoodie).

In addition to the RDF store, I've checked the [Freedom From Religion Foundation](http://www.ffrf.org/shop/), and the [NCSE](http://ncse.com/ncsestore), the [American Atheists](https://atheists.org/store). I've even checked Cafe Press and Zazzle.

Is there any beanie specifically for atheism, or secularity? I'd prefer to find something where the message was more subtle: nothing overly offensive.

**Update**

[I found a beanie with a large 'A'](http://cgi.ebay.com/BEANIE-ATLANTA-BRAVES-Baseball-SKULL-Wrap-HAT-BLACK-/120660961359?pt=US_Hats&hash=item1c17f4284f) but apparently it is for a baseball team.

Have you tried Hot Topic? 



Seriously.

Do you mean a baseball-cap-like beanie (with or without bill), or do you mean a tuque of the close-fitting variety?
