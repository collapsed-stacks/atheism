There is a very common argument for existence of intelligent creator of the universe: 

"If any one of the values of several dozen physical constants wasn't "set" to a value extremely close to the actual value we find, then life would not be possible in our universe."

This makes sense since current cosmology declares that physical constants were defined during first moment of the universe.

The counterargument to this is something like this: "The lottery has terrible odds, but someone eventually wins. We won the cosmological lottery, enjoy your winnings."

I thought a while about this counterargument and I doubt it is applicable. You see, we know about only one "lottery ticket" - our universe, and so, we can't say that "someone should win anyway". It seems more like a single dice roll not a lottery. And winning a dice roll on a dice with a trillions sides seems like a miracle to me and an argument for existence of a intelligent creator.

So my question is: do you think "lottery mistake" counterargument is flawed or not and how can you argue your point of view.
