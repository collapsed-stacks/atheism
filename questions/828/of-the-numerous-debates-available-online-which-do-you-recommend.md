There are numerous debates on the likes of youtube, so rather than spending lots of time filtering through all the average to rubbish ones looking for the gold, I'd be interested in finding out peoples favourites.

I'm asking ideally for links to video or audio, but transcripts of particluarly good debates where no video is available would also be welcome.

There are over 500 debates linked to here:
http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=50

I've only managed to watch a couple dozen of these but I'd favourites include ones with Sam Harris, Hitchens, Barker and Arif Ahmed.

I know this is subjective but I'll list a couple that I think are worthwhile listening to:

**Arif Ahmed vs William Lane Craig:**

**Christopher Hitchens vs Tony Blair:**

**Victor Stenger vs William Lane Craig**

<p>I was just watching the <a href="http://vodpod.com/watch/4639675-wrightharris-debate" rel="nofollow">debate of Sam Harris and Robert Wright</a> about how atheists should tackle the question of religion, from our point of view. It very quickly turned into to a debate about Islam. Thought it might be interesting and relevant here. 
Interesting guest in the crowd was Richard Dawkins who had a question for Wright, and I may be mistaking but I think I saw PZ Myers sitting in the front row too.</p>

<p>Though <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0SqEKowAmA" rel="nofollow">this is only 1 segment</a> of a larger debate, I find the 4 parts of this Christopher Hitchens response re: Free Speech (as it relates to religion, ultimately) to be the most compelling I have ever seen.  </p>

<p>Brilliant work from a brilliant man.</p>

<p>Be sure to watch all 4 parts.  Total 20 minutes, I believe.</p>

I immensely enjoyed the debate between [**Shmuley Boteach** and **Christopher Hitchens** at the 92nd Street Y](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnMYL8sF7bQ) although it’s rather long.

Although I disagree with almost everything that Shmuley says I have to admire him for his fierce rhetoric (and that includes his masterly play with rhetoric tricks) and his funny (and sometimes even likable) demeanour.

Richard Dawkins' page on Facebook, has some good discussions amongst the usual nonsense.
