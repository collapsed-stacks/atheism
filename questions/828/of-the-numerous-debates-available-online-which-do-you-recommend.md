There are numerous debates on the likes of youtube, so rather than spending lots of time filtering through all the average to rubbish ones looking for the gold, I'd be interested in finding out peoples favourites.

I'm asking ideally for links to video or audio, but transcripts of particluarly good debates where no video is available would also be welcome.
