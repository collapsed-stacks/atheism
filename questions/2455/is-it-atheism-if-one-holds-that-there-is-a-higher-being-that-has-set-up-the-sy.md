Is it atheism if one holds that there is a higher "being" that has set the system up but does not care about individuals' actions?

That is what I think based on the complexity and sophistication of time and life. I think that the "creator" entity is so far removed from us in sophistication, that our ability to "understand" it is more unlikely than ability of a fly to understand how computers work.

From the standpoint of practical choices, I don't see how life's choices would differ between the true atheist (no God period) and the [there must be some sort of design/creator-entity who it is impossible to understand or relate to].

Please point me to some work if there is any on the subject. If there is a specific name for this type of belief, please let me know.
