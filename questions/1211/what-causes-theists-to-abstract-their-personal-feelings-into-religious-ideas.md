I don't know how many times I've encountered a religious person who, when sincerely hoping for a particular event or outcome, abstracts away their personal involvement and says something to the effect of "It's in God's hands now". Atheists, in my experience, tend to be much more practical and actively *look* for ways to get involved, or even just acknowledge that they have an emotion called "hope" and are actively *doing* some hoping.

This happens in innumerable other situations: two people don't just fall in love, they were *brought* together by the powers that be; a man behaves irrationally not because he's mentally unsound or simply upset, but because he was *brought* to do so by forces beyond him.

It seems to me that this is an attempt on the part of these people to absolve themselves of being involved in their own lives, to take away from their own free will and thus free themselves from the burden of responsibility. But what motivates a person to do this in the first place? Are all religious people necessarily like this at some level? What makes a person give up a lead role in their own life?
