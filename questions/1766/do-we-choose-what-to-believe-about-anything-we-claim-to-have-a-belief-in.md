## Do we choose (what) to believe? (About anything we claim to have a belief in... not just "God.")

This is a concept I've been spending a lot of time (too much?) thinking about recently.    

It all started while I was reading the transcript of an online debate, involving Richard Dawkins and ... well, someone else who doesn't play into the question.  
The transcript read:
***
**15:06 Hannah Devlin (moderator):**
We've got a lot of questions coming in on why it is possible to "choose" to believe. …  
  **15:06 Richard Dawkins:** (quoting someone else in the chat)

> "How can you 'choose to believe'?"

**RD:**  Yes indeed, how can you? Either the evidence supports something or it does not. Choice shouldn't come into belief”
*******
Wow... this is counter to everything I've chosen to believe... and from a prominent, "leading" atheist, no less.  Richard implies there is no choice when deciding whether or not to accept a given piece of evidence, or a given truth claim.  Really?  Is there no "choice" involved in deciding whether one will accept evidence?  I think this is really thorny.

How did I "choose" to stop believing that the Bible was the inerrant "Word of God," and allow myself to consider other propositions?  Do I "choose" to believe that the sun will rise tomorrow?  Or has that choice been stolen by the 45 years of it actually rising every day?

I have an answer substantially formed... but I want to see if this very simple question nags others the way it did me, or if anyone brings up angles I haven't considered.
