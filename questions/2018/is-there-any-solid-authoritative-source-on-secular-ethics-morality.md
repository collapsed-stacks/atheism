<p>When I saw this question I thought of this TED talk: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html" rel="nofollow">Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions</a>. While I'm not convinced by everything he says, it is certainly thought provoking.</p>

<p>I have heard goods things about Sam Harris's <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1439171211" rel="nofollow">The Moral Landscape</a>. </p>

<p>I wouldn't call it authoritative though.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_god_delusion">"The God Delusion" by Richard Dawknis</a> deals with the ethics/morality issue, and, in my opinion, is very well argued. For something more academic, Phil Zuckerman has <a href="http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf">an interesting paper</a> relating atheism and secularity to societal well-being. I have found the list of references in this paper especially interesting as well.

Hope this helps.

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1591026040" rel="nofollow">The Secular Conscience, by Austin Dacey.</a>  A bit dry, but (IMHO) makes a very good case why all societal, and ultimately moral, issues must be negotiated on equal terms among all parties. </p>

<p>No resorting to "revelatory" trump cards.  No taking your ball and going home.  No claims to private, unknowable reasons for your laws.</p>
