Since atheists tend to have a naturalistic worldview, are they more drawn towards science as a result of their atheism? Does atheism increase their level of interest in Science?

I would say that it's as least as often the other way around; those who are attracted to and interested in science frequently discover that it suggests there is no god.

Many atheists are unquestionably drawn to science as a consequence of their views, but there are many atheists for whom it is not a significant issue.

I don't believe Atheism necessarily enlarges one's interest in science, or even affects one's attitude towards it. I think that being an atheist is about being realistic and rational. These things are required I think for taking an interest in science, but that doesn't necessarily mean that a realistic, rational person would automatically have an interest in science.

On the other hand, if you don't believe in creationism and you are interested in knowing what life is all about, and why you are all here, you do need science. And since I think almost everyone has an urge for knowing what life is all about at some point in their life, they would then automatically be drawn towards evolution and the likes.

I think atheism implies that its followers *know* more than believers which usually only *believe*. I'm also disappointed that religions are our past and made so many people think that this is normal to believe priests religious prejudices, and we, atheists, should contests this confidence to church. Thus, I suppose, the less you're indifferent about knowledge and enlightement of people, the more you should know to find proper arguments and to carry the truth to ignorant, because the latter have so many naive and stereotypic reasons to believe.

I am not sure that atheism is a direct cause for people to be interested in science.

What I am sure is that the more a person is a naturalist and interested rational and reality, the more likely it is that the person will be an atheist and interested in science.

I know many atheists who couldn't care less about how things work and why the nature is the way it is. They just don't believe in any gods or superstition, and live their lives in a naturalistic ways. They don't fear evolution and cosmology, they just aren't interested in the details because they don't see the relevance to their daily lives.

To sum it up, I think that the same mechanisms that make people atheist, will also make people enjoy science.

Curiosity perhaps?

Something I've found over the years, is that often *priests* have serious doubts about God. I've also known plenty of atheistic liberal arts majors.

On the other hand,  I've known more than a few science types who were quite religious.

I'd say that there is definitely a correlation with education, but that it's not so much about science, as about how much you actually think about this sort of thing.

Science is (*or at least strives to be*) self-consistent - religious belief is (*patently*) not. I think atheism allows you to take science at face value, without having to retro-fit any discoveries into any religious framework you may have.

So, I would have thought atheists would always be more willing to accept new discoveries, and to question them, as they wouldn't be upsetting any "religiously protected" beliefs they might hold.

That's not to say that scientist don't cling on to stubbornly held beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. The great Fred Hoyle beliveed in a steady-starte universe until his death - "Big Bang" was meant to be derogatory term... :-)

An Atheist who does take an interest in science wont twist it to fit their world view. The might be even more critical of what science tells them.
