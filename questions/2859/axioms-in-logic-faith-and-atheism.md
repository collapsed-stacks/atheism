It seems that we atheists pride ourselves on the logical examination of evidence. In any system of logic- we must first start with axioms- that is unprovable assumptions that are accepted on their very nature as being true. 

I purposefully avoid the definition of axiom as a "universally accepted truth" because it seems that such an assertion in inherently subjective. In what we believe, as atheists, we must first accept such axioms as (1) the existence of self and (2) the existence of a reality around us. By their very nature such assumptions are unprovable as we cannot step outside ourselves or even the universe to examine any evidence of an ultimate truth. 

How do atheists differentiate between what we call faith (a believe in the axiom of a deity) from the belief in our own axioms that support the logical systems that disprove the existence of God? 

One matter to address, is an argument that can be made where, when following any chain of logical reasoning, we can ask for evidence over and over until we finally come up against something unprovable- axioms. In turn, the acceptance of these might be called faith, is this semantic twist simply renaming God?
