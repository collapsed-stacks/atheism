What are some atheist groups with formal documents on their ideals? (Ethical Culture Society, so on) Or, if they exist, documents by Atheists to cover ideals for any Athiest?

There are no "Atheist Ideals" because atheism is ONLY the lack of a belief in gods.

But you are probably really asking about larger philosophies which can include atheism, such as:

 - Secular Humanism
 - Skepticism
 - Materialism
 - Buddhism

Check out Secular Humanism - they even have a formal Manifesto (or two).

I feel that the thing Atheism promotes the most is rational thinking and in effect the lack of belief in god thanks to rational thinking. Rationality however, is a very flexible thing because humans are not known for being rational, despite how far we try to attain it. A formal declaration of the utmost rationality would not appeal to the emotional side in people, and thus it is unlikely a 'formal declaration' of atheist ideals would be "general" to all atheists.

(E.g. my idea is different from Noisician's perspective. There's a different logical perspective for everything.)
