When debating a muslim on the validity of their faith what are the common arguments that you come up against and how do you concisely refute them in a way that will challenge them rather than slap them down.

Answers should be in a form that would challenge muslims, rather than get applause from atheists.

This is from a series of posts.

102 - Moral Islam

Its obvious that Islam is far from being moral. While Mohammed did a few moral things, such as stopping the tradition of burying infant girls, the number of immoral things he did far outnumber the moral ones, and had lasting consequences. Some examples are:

- A man being allowed to have four wives while a woman only gets one husband.

- Men getting double the share in inheritence, furthermore even their testimony is worth the testimony of two women in a court of islamic law.

- Mohammed having 11 wives, various sex slaves, most of them much younger than him, and having sex with a 9 year old child. 

- Allowing women captured during war to become the sex slaves of muslims, and their rape being permissible. (E.g, if a town is attacked by muslims, all women inside are free to be captured and taken as slaves).

- Killing of apostates. If a muslim leaves islam, he is to be given 3 days to repent, and if he doesn't, he is to be killed, under islamic law.
