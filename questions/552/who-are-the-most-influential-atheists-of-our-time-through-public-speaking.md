It has to be Richard Dawkins. Extremely intelligent and profuse author and speaker.

His logic is unassailable.

What, no love for Stephen Fry? He and Hitch tag-teamed in taking on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCdnh7G87m4&feature=&p=7CF8AFD815FFA216&index=0&playnext=1">the entire Catholic church.</a> The church lost, badly.

I'd vote for either Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens.  Of course, that's not to downplay the likes of Dan Barker, Sam Harris, Mike Newdow, or Daniel Dennett...

<p>I would choose Richard Dawkins and Steven Hawking. I included Steven Hawking because he has recently written a book <em>The Grand Design</em> which has many evidences that the Universe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Hawking#Religious_views" rel="nofollow">might come into existence without God</a>. As a physicist he may shed a lot of light on existence and the Universe from cosmological point of view.</p>

<p>I like several of Dan Dennett's talks, especially some of <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/dan_dennett.html" rel="nofollow">his TED talks</a>.  </p>

<p>I would contend he is more influential and widely acceptable than Dawkins, whose aggressive views and acerbic statements are unlikely to win over any theists, just as Ted Haggard is unlikely to win over many atheists.  In the popular news-media, Dawkins does win hands-down on volume because of those reasons, but once someone listens to either, I would contend that Dennett's calm demeanor would win over more people.</p>

<p>Dennett's dual might be <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_honey_on_god_and_the_tsunami.html" rel="nofollow">Rev. Tom Honey</a>, one of the few theologians I like to listen to.</p>

Christopher Hitchens is tops for me. In criticizing religion, he uses eloquent speech and logic like an epee. One never knows what gem he will utter when debating the godists but he never fails to enlighten and amuse. May he have years more to have his say.

Hands down Hitchens, in terms of effectiveness in debating and expressing ideas with passion!  Second prize for scalpel-like precision: Sam Harris.

There are so many but the ones I tend to give more time to are PZ Myers, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Fry and posthumously Douglas Adams.

Agree with lots of the people mentioned but would also add Victor Stenger. He is not necessarily the most charismatic but I think he puts his points across clearly and dismantles opposing points well, and he takes on the likes of William Lane Craig.

I wish I could find a debate where Hitchens clearly rebuts Lane Craig's nonsense.
