Are atheists smarter than believers... or are they reprobates... totally closed off from the grace required to believe and have faith?

Seems like there are smart and not-so-smart atheists and believers. So it can't be intelligence.

To me atheism arguments are like 4 people arguing about a photograph of Exhibit A and its properties. Can't know for sure whether Exhibit A exists merely from looking at photographs. Could be a staged picture, or computer enhanced imagery.

The debate continues, but then Person Y actually sees Exhibit A. The debate ends for him. He no longer needs to rely on intellect, analysis, or power of observation to determine whether Exhibit A exists. He has seen and experienced Exhibit A.

He might still find the debate interesting, but not compelling.

And if the only way Exhibit A can been seen, is the Exhibit itself reveals itself, it makes it more interesting. Exhibit A can't be found. It can only be experienced if revealed.

I spent many years as an atheist and loved the debates, but the have lost a little steam, after having encountered Exhibit A.
