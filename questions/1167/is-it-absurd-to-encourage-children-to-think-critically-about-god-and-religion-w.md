We encourage our children to think carefully and critically about the religious teaching they receive at school (Church of England) while at the some time indulging them (indeed, very carefully keeping the truth from them) with regard to Father Christmas.

This has got to be absurd, hasn't it? Yet it feels quite natural. Is there some way of rationalising the difference between the two kinds of belief, at least to ourselves, without getting lost in philosophical contradictions?
