In cases where someone, whom you otherwise respect, has successfully used religion to turn their life around (e.g. break a habit of substance abuse); how can you politely reason with them when they confidently start telling you about their unthinking and naive beliefs (e.g. that they will pray for some outcome)? 

How can you tell them that their beliefs which seem to have been so useful in cleaning up one aspect of their life, are just wrong thinking?
