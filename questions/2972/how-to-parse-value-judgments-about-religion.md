Daily we are exposed to judgmental statements that make categorizations by subjective, moral, or generalized views. For instance- "Religion is full of idiots" or "The Bible has some good things to say". This question is about the utility of these judgmental expressions (positive or negative) about religion. As such- I am also interested in the perceived effect of such judgement on a potential deconvert. 

 - Do positive judgements lead to uncertainty in a potential deconvert and possibly open atheists to unwanted attempts at conversion?

 - Do negative judgements lead to a continuous strife- lessening the potential of deconverts; also resulting in a characterization of atheism, by the religious, as a negative emotional reaction to religion?  

Don't both forms of judgement arise from emotional thinking- the same character of thought that leads humans to religion?
