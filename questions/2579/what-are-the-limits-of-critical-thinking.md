If at the core of critical thinking is following reason and evidence, how do we handle knowledge so vast that one entire human life of reasoning is not enough to arrive at it? How do we even recognize such knowledge?

It seems to me that many pieces of advice from wise people are easy to dismiss rationally, using critical thinking, simply because the advice does not make sense to you at the time. Once you gain more experience, you begin to understand what previously seemed illogical.

How does a critical thinker, aware of the limitations of their own mental powers, rationally deal with authorities that surpass their mental capacity? How can these authorities be recognized? You cannot simply trust them (would not be critical), but you cannot dismiss them (would not be rational - they are more likely to be close to truth).

Does this mean that critical thinking is limited? Are the limits known?
