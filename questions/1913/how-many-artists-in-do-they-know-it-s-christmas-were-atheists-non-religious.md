The song ["Do they know it's Christmas" (link to participants)][1] was a massive success for a humanitarian purpose that had a non-secular message embedded in it. With respect to activism in society at large, I had a question about non-religious or atheist activity in causes that ultimately have a religious underpinning. I am not sure if there is a straightforward resource for finding out which celebrities are declared non-religious, so I will turn the question over to you...

How many of the original 1984 participants were non-religious or atheist?
