In short, one form of the the argument goes:

1. The values of various physical constants that describe the Universe are such that very slight variations in any of them would result in a Universe incapable of supporting life.
2. It is enormously unlikely that this life-supporting set of values for the constants would occur by chance.
3. Therefore it is probable that the values of the constants was set deliberately (eg by God).
