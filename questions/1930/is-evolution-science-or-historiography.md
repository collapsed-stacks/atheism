As I understand Science it is something you theoretically can observe by yourself. Someone claims he had observers something under certain conditions and you can make your own experiment.

A historian looks at records of the past and draws its conclusions without the possibility to recreate the historic context and let it happen again. He just can suspect what might have happened at a very high probability.

*Eg.: One can Take an Apple and let him fall down and you have evaluated gravity through own experience. But if you find an Apple lying on the ground you can only suspect it fell down, or someone put it there…*

Having this in mind is evolution science, historiography, a "scientific theory of history" or something else?

EDIT: the term Evolution in this question was not well defined. Certain kinds of Evolutions can be certainly scientifically observed. But what about this part of evolution that finally gets rid of a need for a god or a higher being to initialize. The part of evolution that explains how time, space and matter evolved and what describes the common ancestor of humans and apple trees.
