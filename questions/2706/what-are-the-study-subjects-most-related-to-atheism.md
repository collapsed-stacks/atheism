Any religion I know is extremely complex, and has many fields of study.
Atheism is simpler, and I'm trying to find more to know related to it.

I have found the following study fields so far

 * Atheist arguments (arguments against the existence of God)
 * Counter-theist arguments (arguments that disproves arguments for the existence of God)
 * Origin of the universe
 * Origin of life

Do you know more?
