Can't we just not believe in organized religion But believe in a intelligent creator of the solar system and the universe  There are too many things about are solar system that point to an intelligent creator, like the fact that our planet is just the right distant from the Sun for life to exist.  The moon is the exact distance it needs to be for life to exist.  The tilt of the planet is just right for life to exist.  I could go on an on there are like twenty facts like this.

Who built the pyramids, stonehenge, and all the other amazing things around the world that are unexplained.

My beliefs are that alien astronauts are responsible for all of that and the missing link and the beginning of all religions on Earth.

No third party had to have started evolution. We accept that there are things we don't know, we actually expect them. We'll eventually find a scientifically valid theory to explain it, maybe, and if not, oh well; a strange and unsupportable hypothesis isn't the way to go.

The things you mention were built by, surprise, humans. Even if we accepted the fine tuning argument, it doesn't speak to what the fine tuner is or was. Your facts aren't all correct, the Earth has a huge band around the sun where it's habitable. If other factors had been different we may not have evolved or may have evolved differently to suit a differing climate, but everything is in this configuration and we did evolve this way.

The lottery has terrible odds, but someone eventually wins. We won the cosmological lottery, enjoy your winnings.

<p>There are several compelling natural hypotheses for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis" rel="nofollow">abiogenesis</a> none of which require a supernatural 'first cause.' By injecting a first cause argument you are removing yourself from science by believing in something that cannot be tested or falsified. Just because life arose on this planet under these circumstances does not mean that it couldn't exist elsewhere. Living organisms were just <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html" rel="nofollow">found</a> in a poisonous lake in California that, according to previous theories should have not been able to sustain anything. This goes to show that we could possibly find life in other places that we had previously considered uninhabitable</p>
