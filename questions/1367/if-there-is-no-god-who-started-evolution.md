Can't we just not believe in organized religion But believe in a intelligent creator of the solar system and the universe  There are too many things about are solar system that point to an intelligent creator, like the fact that our planet is just the right distant from the Sun for life to exist.  The moon is the exact distance it needs to be for life to exist.  The tilt of the planet is just right for life to exist.  I could go on an on there are like twenty facts like this.

Who built the pyramids, stonehenge, and all the other amazing things around the world that are unexplained.

My beliefs are that alien astronauts are responsible for all of that and the missing link and the beginning of all religions on Earth.
