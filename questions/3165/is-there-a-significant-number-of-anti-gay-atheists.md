I'm supposing that the removal of religion from the question of homosexuality and morality greatly reduces the number of anti-gay atheists.  Are there notable exceptions?  

We often hear religious people try to coach their discussions about homosexuality in secular, biological arguments.  I don't think I've ever heard any atheists make the same claims (i.e. that homosexuality is unnatural and/or that its unnaturalness makes it immoral).
