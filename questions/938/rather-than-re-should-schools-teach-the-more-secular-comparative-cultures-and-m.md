As an alternative to Religious Education considered by many education authorities as compulsory within the curriculum, would it be more appropriate to study belief systems celebrating the benefits of comparative cultures?  Moreover, as it is widely held that there is a tenuous link between religious teaching and moral guidance, should moral teachings be centred on our current understandings of the moral zeitgeist i.e what is contemporary accepted as the standard of morality?
