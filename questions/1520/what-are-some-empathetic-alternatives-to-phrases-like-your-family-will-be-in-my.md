In cases where a friend or family member looses someone close to them, as an atheist I find that I have a hard time properly expressing empathy/sympathy, since so much of the language that is used in such situations is tied up with religious concepts. You will often hear such comments "He/She is in a better place," or "Your family will be in my prayers." While there are alternatives such as, "Your family will be in my thoughts," and the ever-popular, "I'm sorry for your loss," they do not seem to have anywhere near the same emotional impact, and therefore make me feel awkward in such situations.
