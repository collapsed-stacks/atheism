In arguing for atheism various science and science-y topics and debate points creep into discussion.  I generally prefer to talk about things I'm knowledgeable of, and avoid making tenuous connections where I shouldn't.  What specific scientific arguments have you seen stretched too thin, how can I avoid them, and what alternatives are there?
