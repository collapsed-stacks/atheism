I once got into an email conversation with Matt Dilahunty, of the Austin Atheist Experience. I was making some statements about religion having some positive attributes and he was having nothing to do with that. He put the question to me in a similar fashion to how I ask it here. His version was more like: Is there anything that religions do or have done that couldn’t be done without it?

I argued that you could ask something similar about just about anything and arrive at a similar answer. The expansion of prosperity brought about by capitalism could have been done differently, maybe even better. Many wars could have been prevented by earlier political intervention. Free societies are often formed peacefully proving that violent revolution is not always necessary. 

When put the way I put it here, it becomes nearly impossible to answer yes. I’m not claiming to have thought this up, but I don’t a have a source. The consequences of this  leads to a different way of thinking:

 - Even if you are a proponent of religion’s positive role in history, if you answer no to this question, then anything previously labeled “religion” has to be relabeled. Label it sociology, evolutionary biology, or wisdom through the ages but don’t call it something that depends on a being that intervenes with nature. 

 - It frees us to discuss those positive impacts of religion without relegating them to religion alone. If there are positive reasons for people getting together and singing once a week, then lets examine them and see how we can use them. If escalating a minor insult into a violent situation is bad, and a story about turning the other cheek is a way to teach that, then lets do it. 

 - We don’t need to require that you recite the apostle’s creed at the end of the lesson, and no one gets to claim that they have exclusive rights to the story, or that it was their God that thought it up. 

Edit: Change "do" to "accomplish". That is anything tangible, art, war, ideas, cultural change, building a hospital, good or bad, doesn't matter.
