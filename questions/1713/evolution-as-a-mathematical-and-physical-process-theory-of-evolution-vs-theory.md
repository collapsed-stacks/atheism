I often see people try to stand on *"Evolution as a Mathematical Process."* This often plays into the hands of a common theological argument about math and analytical truths. This can be won, but it requires work. It goes like this:

> If evolution is a certain or as fruitful as physics, why hasn't it yielded an equation of the sort `E = MC^2` ?

There are all kinds of variations of this argument, and it is most often seen when evolutionists (excuse the use of this word, it will never happen again) make the claim that theory of evolution is on par with the theory of gravity. [It's becoming rather pervasive](http://www.zazzle.com/evolution_is_just_a_theory_mens_shirt-235144242112412190).

> If evolution and gravity are both a theory, and I'm to believe they both have an equal amount of evidence, then what can you tell me about the human species in 15,000 years? I'll happily tell you the chances of a tracked asteroid colliding with the moon on that date, and the force the moon will exert on the moon..

I'd like to know:

* What kind of quantification can be done for biological evolution?
* What is the most powerful rebuttal to the argument that gravity is a *more certain* theory?
* Is it wrong to say that the theory of evolution can only ever make qualitative predictions?
* Is it dangerous to concede the point that biology can not yet live up to the level of quantification of physics, and it never will, thus affirming it is less certain?
