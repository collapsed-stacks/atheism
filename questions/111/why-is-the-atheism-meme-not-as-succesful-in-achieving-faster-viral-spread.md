Considering memetics, and Susan Blackmore's take that memes with altruism built-in, is more successful in spreading, how do you think one could carefully construct a memepool for a greater *virality* in Atheism?

For those unfamiliar with memetics, a short description follows:

>A meme consists of any unit of cultural information, such as a practice or idea, that gets transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another. Examples include thoughts, ideas, theories, practices, habits, songs, dances and moods and terms such as race, culture, and ethnicity. Memes propagate themselves and can move through a “culture” in a manner similar to the behavior of a virus.
