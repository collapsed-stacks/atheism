Many of us often hear religious people claiming that even Charles Darwin himself accepted God in his dying days (these same people often also claim that Albert Einstein was a religious man). Both have been refuted many times. 

I would like to see the definite answer about the origin of this claim and some quotes that negate (or prove) it.
