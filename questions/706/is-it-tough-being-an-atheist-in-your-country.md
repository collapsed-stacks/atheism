When browsing this site and reading the questions and answers I get a general feeling that for some people being an atheist is a really big deal. Talks about "coming out of the closet" is hard for me to understand. It is probably a cultural difference, because I live in the Netherlands and over here no-one is discriminated for being an atheist and no-one is afraid to let anybody know they are an atheist; as fas as I know. Therefore I find it strange that a lot of atheists I meet online feel like they are rejected by society and are putting unnecessary emphasis on being an atheist or dare not speak of it with their family or friends. I can see how people from countries with orthodox religious regimes would act like that, but people from the USA, for example, also do, while it is clearly stated in their constitution that the country is not built upon or associated with any kind of religion. What causes this "outlawed" status of atheists in some supposedly free countries?

When browsing this site and reading the questions and answers I get a general feeling that for some people being an atheist is a really big deal. Talks about "coming out of the closet" is hard for me to understand. It is probably a cultural difference, because I live in the Netherlands and over here no-one is discriminated for being an atheist and no-one is afraid to let anybody know they are an atheist; as fas as I know. Therefore I find it strange that a lot of atheists I meet online feel like they are rejected by society and are putting unnecessary emphasis on being an atheist or dare not speak of it with their family or friends. I can see how people from countries with orthodox religious regimes would act like that, but people from the USA, for example, also do, while it is clearly stated in their constitution that the country is not built upon or associated with any kind of religion. What causes this "outlawed" status of atheists in some supposedly free countries?
