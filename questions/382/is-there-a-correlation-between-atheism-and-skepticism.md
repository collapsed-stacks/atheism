Many atheists have arrived at the atheist conclusion based on skeptical (or sceptical!) thinking, and by being unable to see evidence of any sort of deity based on empirical data. 

Is this same skeptical thinking applied to all other aspects of a person's life? Are atheists less likely to believe that alt-med (homeopathy, naturopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic, etc.) works, or other phenomena (UFOs, bigfoot, the Illuminati runs the world from its secret base in Switzerland, 9/11 was an inside job) than other members of the population, or are there individuals who are able to maintain beliefs in other nonsensical mythology whilst disregarding the god hypothesis for garbage?
