In a Gallup poll about Park51 (also known as Cordoba House and also called some derogatory things), opinions were broken down by religion, and atheists were the second-strongest supporters ([this link](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/11/23/mosque-near-ground-zero-matter-faith/) is to a Fox News Op-Ed column, but I doubt they miscopied the numbers):

 1. Muslims were the most supportive, with 14% wanting relocation, 43% in favor of it staying, and 30% wanting an interfaith institution instead.
 2. Atheists were the second most supportive: 32% want relocation, 42% want it to stay, and 17% wanting interfaith
 3. Jews were 43%, 25% and 28%
 4. Protestants were 49%, 18% and 23%
 5. Catholics were 63%, 15% and 15%

Is atheist support for a building that has some religious components in it somewhat paradoxical? What factors influence this? Do any of the following fit:

 - Are atheists less likely to blame Islam (or religion in general) for 9/11?
 - Are atheists are less likely to view Islam as an out-group, and therefore don't suffer from [Out-group homogeneity bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity_bias)?
 - Are atheists more likely to be left-wing, and therefore supporting freedom of expression even when others find something offensive?
