For example I consider the depiction of the a woman's role in marriage as defined by the christian bible to be sexual slavery, but I cannot quote a passage that attests to this. I have read the entire bible and this was one point that stuck out strongly to me, yet I am not a good enough scholar to know the answer off hand.
