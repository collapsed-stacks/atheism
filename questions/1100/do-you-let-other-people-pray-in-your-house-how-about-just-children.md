## Do you let other people pray in your house? How about just children?

We were watching our two nieces (5 and 3) for the evening a few weeks ago. We sat down to dinner, and as we were plating the pizza, the older girl pipes up "Oh! We forgot to pray!"

What to do?

Now, on the one hand, when I'm at my in-laws' homes, and they have a prayer before the meal, I just shut my mouth and let them do as they choose, since it's their house(s). And at our house, we don't praise or thank imaginary friends before we eat; we wish another a hearty appetite and we thank the cook.

On the other hand, she's five, and this is how her parents are raising her.

If they were adults, I would not have allowed them to lead us in prayer. (If they want to pray silently and not bother anyone else, that's fine.) But do kids get a pass?
