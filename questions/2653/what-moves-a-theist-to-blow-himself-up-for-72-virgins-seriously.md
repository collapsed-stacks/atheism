In the debate about learning from atheists, I stated, that 'why to kill people and yourself' is a question what we could learn about atheists, not from atheists. <http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2638/what-can-atheists-learn-from-theists-religion/2640#2640>

And _Lauren Ipsum_ answered: No, you have to be religious to explain that. 

And I don't agree, but there it will get off topic, so I start a new one here. 

My idea is: The religious person is not really self-aware, not  conscious and skeptic enough about himself, to explain what he is doing and why. Of course he has an inner perspective, and a rationalization, an explanation why he is doing this - maybe because of 72 virgins. But that is very a selfish explanation, not very spiritual - isn't it? It might convince an rationalist, if he would believe these virgins were real, and if he would be so amorally, to kill people for his own pleasure. 

Let's get another viewpoint. I'm living in a western society, in Germany to make it concrete, and there are often psychologists asked by media to explain criminal acts which are hard to understand. But I've seen very few attempts to explain suicide bombings. Did you? Is there a fear to find ourself when searching for the answer? 

And another perspective: Our brain as atheists - is it different from the brain of theists? Is it different between theists who commit such terror, and brave theists, who won't do you any harm? Or are our brains too similar to make such a distinction? Well, there are hormones, which affect our mood and what we think, and we have influence - be it music, be it drugs, be it work or sports, ... - there is the possibility to boost them or to damp them, and a surrounding culture might tolerate, might encourage, tolerate or discourage them. 

My thesis is: Observing a coincidence of religious believes and such assassination is just the first step, is just the observation of a symptom. And religion doesn't explain much here. A serious attempt to explain such actions would try to find similar patterns in other societies and cultures, and not just see the low hanging fruit in an academic debate. A radical, nonreligious viewpoint can't accept religion as cause of such effect. 

Instead, religion is the often used shortcut to refuse reasoning, to refuse thinking, a joker where - maybe - a taboo is sitting. 

And the short form of the question is: How can we understand a jihadist without accepting his religion as explanation? Is there a more useful perspective than pointing to the fault of faith?
