People talk about Hitler as being one of the most evil characters in history. Christianity from its inception has killed way more then Hitler has. In the black death periods there were burning 100s of thousand of people, jews, women etc because they were thought to be "witches" or what ever and there are so many documented examples of these 2 religions committing serious crimes way worst then Hitler. How the hell do they get away with it, and no one ever talks about it?
