If intelligent alien life were found elsewhere in the universe, how would this impact the major religions of earth? Would people find it easy to continue believing the same things they were taught, or would it make it more difficult to believe in tenents such as humans being a special creation, prophets being sent to all human populations to deliver god's message, etc?
