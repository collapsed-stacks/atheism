I think of religion as a mental illness, one that is spread similarly to a virus.  The infected frequently suffer from delusions (especially of grandeur) and other symptoms normally classified as mental illnesses and a side effect seems to be an eagerness to spread the disease.  The best preventative and cure is religious education, but that is frequently not enough.  Am I being too harsh, or does anyone else think this is accurate?
