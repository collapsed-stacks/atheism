There was recently a debate between Christopher Hitchens and Tony Blair.  It got a decent amount of press (e.g. [here from the Guardian][1]).  Does anyone know if the video is online?

<p>It's also available from <a href="http://munkdebates.com/debates/Religion" rel="nofollow" title="munkdebates.com">munkdebates.com</a>, for a small fee, but the quality is a lot better than the youtube video.</p>
