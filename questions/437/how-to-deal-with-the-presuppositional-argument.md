I was in a debate recently with a Christian whose stance was the "presuppositional" argument - there is surprisingly very little advice/info online on how to respond and reason with Christians who employ this stance.

The presuppositional argument (or a form of it), for those who do not know, is the idea that only the Christian worldview can properly explain the existence of things like "logic".  Basically, if you encounter one of these Christians, they will ask what your "basis" is.  If you say observational and mathematical proof is how you come to the truth, they will argue that you're "presupposing" that those things are the same for the entire universe, thus your entire worldview is flawed.  They will say their worldview is consistent, since all things stem from God (including things not measurable/observable, i.e. logic), while the atheist worldview cannot adequately explain the existence of such things.

In my opinion, the argument breaks down at the same place they attack ours.  They are of course "presupposing" that the bible is the infallible word of God.  Of course, when has pointing out how flawed the bible is convinced these people?  

Has anyone encountered this (or similar) arguments from Christians, and if so, how did you respond?
