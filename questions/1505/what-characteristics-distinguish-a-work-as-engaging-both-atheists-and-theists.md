The media enjoys the revenues of a good shock story about a shocking work of art involving theism or atheism. As with any other polarizing conversation, the two are not served by fanning the vitriol. Atheists and theists are better served by art works that can motivate them to a better understanding of the others' perspective and keeps them from talking past each other.

What kind of a dialog, or it's phrasing, successfully engages both atheists and theists in works of art? Are there specific themes, or perhaps ways of pulling together a work that will make it one that challenges atheists and theists in such a way that there is communication between the two? How do successful art works differ from the works that break off conversation and cauterize both camps?

[An interesting example of an attempt at dialog between the two camps was when the displays of Damien Hirst (atheist painter/sculpter) and Bill Viola (works about martyrs and saints) were put up in St. Paul's Cathedral][1]. It was a dialog opportunity for everyone willing to be silent for a few minutes while they absorbed the work. Many of the religions and other social groups solidify and expand their influence by engaging in cross-belief dialog; what do successful works have that challenge both groups to understand the other, rather than simply repulse ?
