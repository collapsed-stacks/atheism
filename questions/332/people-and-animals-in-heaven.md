I would like to ask how religious people imagine animals in heaven: whose pet (dog, cat etc.) get to heaven and whose doesn't, whether animals can be born there or not, what happens with them and how it is ruled.

I was raised in the Catholic church and everyone was adamant about animals not having souls and therefore having no place in heaven.  However, with the rise in pet ownership (in the US) and the anthropomorphizing of those pets it is likely that more people and churches are accepting that animals (the ones you put clothes on) have a place in heaven too.

Religion is being watered down. Most Christians are picking the bits they like and ignoring the rest.

It depends on the religion. At least in Islam, dogs are considered unclean and angels don't go to a house which has a dog, so if you're fond of dogs, tough luck because your cute little puppy will be in the depths of hell.
