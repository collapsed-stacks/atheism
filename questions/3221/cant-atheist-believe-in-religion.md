Some religions like Hinduism and Buddhism include atheistic philosophies as well. Can a person call himself atheist and Hindu at the same time in such cases ?

Hindus have gods so the answer would be no.

Buddhism does not recognise a supreme being but is does accept the existence of beings on higher realms, so applying the same atheistic logic to buddhism would probably make the two largely incompatible since many religious claims of buddhism cannot be proven.
