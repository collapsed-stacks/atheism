I'm looking for the most recent developments in research of the Shroud of Turin. What is the current opinion about its origin in the scientific community? It seems that opinions are extremely fragmented. The carbon dating seems to be very debatable, too.

I am not religious, but I must admit that it is suprising that in the age of fantastic scientific achievements no group of scientists has any solid explanation of the properties of a piece of cloth. How hard can it be? Because of that, I hear christians claiming the shroud to be an important artifact that supports their faith.

Any information regarding this would be very welcome.
