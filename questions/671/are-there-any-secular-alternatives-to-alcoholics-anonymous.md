As I'm atheist I don't really fit into or qualify for alcoholics anonymous; what alternative programs are there to quit drinking that don't rely on [God] or scripture?

<p>There's <a href="http://www.cfiwest.org/sos/" rel="nofollow">Secular Organizations for Sobriety</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOS is an alternative recovery method
  for those alcoholics or drug addicts
  who are uncomfortable with the
  spiritual content of widely available
  12-Step programs. SOS takes a
  reasonable, secular approach to
  recovery and maintains that sobriety
  is a separate issue from religion or
  spirituality. SOS credits the
  individual for achieving and
  maintaining his or her own sobriety,
  without reliance on any "Higher
  Power."</p>

Yes, the Penn & Teller episode on AA mentions at least one organization.  You don't have to like them or their delivery to appreciate those facts that they do happen to get right (and I'm not talking about the part on whether or not alcoholism is a "disease", just the part about how AA is a religious organization and not transparent about their motives or success rate).

You can be an atheist and still go to AA.
