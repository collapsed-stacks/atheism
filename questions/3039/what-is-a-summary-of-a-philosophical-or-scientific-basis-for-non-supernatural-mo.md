Has anyone encountered a good summary of philosophical views on morality from an atheistic perspective (preferably sympathetic, but with comments on flaws in the approaches)?  Failing that, can someone list the most important books that cover the topic?

Since theists tend to assume that they automatically have the high ground when it comes to morality, it would be nice to at least have an authoritative place to point them to explain current thinking on the topic, or to point atheists who are curious about the subject.

My impression seems to be that the justification for morality has been difficult for both religious and non-religious philosophers, and that almost every proposal has at least one and sometimes many nearly trivial serious flaws with it.

Possible authors include the Churchlands, though in those things that I've read, I've had the impression that they don't think it's an interesting problem; Dennett, though it has seemed to me in the past that he redefines his way out of the issue more than tackling it; Marc Hauser, except although he presents very interesting data on moral behavior, he doens't really cover the logical justification for morality; and Sam Harris, who makes a head-on attempt that is solidly consequentialist and unfortunately fails to address the most basic problems with such an approach.
