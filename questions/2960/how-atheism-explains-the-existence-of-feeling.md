Atheists typically believe in the evolution of mankind from a single cell into a complex creature. Assuming this very physical process, how does it explain the feelings and emotional states of humankind at the present time, like sadness, happiness, laughter, goodness, etc. How is it possible that the feelings of humankind are developed by a physical cause during the time?
