I heard an interesting argument for Christian beliefs lately. It goes something like this:

> The Bible was written by many people
> and is often updated over the years.
> Wikipedia uses a similar method, where
> many people collaborate which yields
> greater accuracy over time due to the
> improvements made. Therefore, the
> Bible, like Wikipedia, is an accurate
> source of evidence, although not perfect.

My response to this is based upon the fact that the Bible lacks the citations that Wikipedia has, but what is the best response.
