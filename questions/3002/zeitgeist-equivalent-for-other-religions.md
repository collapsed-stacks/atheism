Are there any documentaries that are critical of Abrahamic religions individually in detail, not just documentaries criticizing the general notion of belief and God?

<p><a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/islam-what-the-west-needs-to-know/" rel="nofollow">You might try this</a>. There are many other good documentaries at this site about Islam and other religions as well as other topics. It covers the question of whether Islam is peaceful or not. It contains some scholarly work. I eventually stopped listening though when they kept talking about "the Muslims" as if there was something genetic that made you a Muslim. They were trying to make the case that the religion has precepts that get passed down through generations and make people violent. </p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you like the website. There are 68 documentaries on religion.</p>
