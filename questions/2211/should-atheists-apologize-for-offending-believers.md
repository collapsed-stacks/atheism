The general question stands on its own, but I'll provide a specific example, which also merits a "Yes" or "No" answer.  Regardless of answer, please justify/explain it and what the atheist should do.

A friend, suffering a major medical trauma, has a wife who rubs holy water from Lourdes onto the affected area.  Devout Catholic doesn't sufficiently describe her level of devotion.  The friend is seeking every available medical option, and mentions to me very slightly jokingly, "I can tell you one thing, the Lourdes water isn't working."  In an e-mail to him a few weeks later I say, "I'm sending you some things, and including a bottle of tap water you can try rubbing in."

The wife reads his e-mails, initially blames my friend for joking about her faith, but ultimately ends up demanding I issue her a written apology. 

So should I?  Should any atheist in a similar situation?

**Edit:** Injury is chronically debilitating, not life threatening, so there's no "tragedy" in the situation as one responder asked.
