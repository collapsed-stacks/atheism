The only ones that I have found of any real value are the Atheist Experience and NonProphets radio .... is there any other regular show which promotes the rational/naturalistic world view ?

<p>My favorite is <a href="http://atheist-experience.com/" rel="nofollow">Atheist-experience</a> from Atheist community of Austin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Watch us on ustream, or you can
  directly stream Public Access Ch 16
  from Channel Austin's server without
  IRC here(link). We are on 4:30 to 5:30
  pm CST (22:30-23:30 UTC).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most fun part is religious callers.</p>

There are various channels on youtube about atheism. I'm subscribed to [AtheistStream](http://www.youtube.com/user/AtheistStream).

Steve Novella and the Rogues' Gallery run the Excellent <a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/">Skeptics' Guide to the Universe</a> and the intermittent "5x5" (Five minutes with five skeptics on one topic) .

These are the atheist & skeptical podcasts that I like and listen to a lot. So I think all of them are pretty darn good. Plus, I commute about 3 hours a day :( 

 - American Freethought 
 - Ask an Atheist - live call-in radio show + podcast
 - Atheist Experience - live call-in tv + podcast (my favorite of all)
 - Atheist News
 - Chariots of Iron
 - Dogma Free America (a favorite)
 - Freethought Radio - Freedom From Religion official show
 - Good Atheist
 - Godless Business - from Australia
 - Irreligiosophy - ex-mormons, often politically incorrect humor
 - Non Prophets - same crew as Atheist Experience, but no callers or tv
 - Reasonable Doubts
 - Secular Nation - readings from AAI Secular Nation magazine + author interviews
 - Skeptoid - short 10-15 minutes on single topic of pseudoscience
 - Skeptics Guide to the Universe - science & skepticism (a favorite)
 - Unbelievers

These additional podcasts might also be good, but just haven't yet sparked my interest enough to make them part of my regular rotation. Different strokes for different folks.

 - Atheist Talk - from Minnesota Atheists, seems a little dry for me.
 - Eight Hour Lunch - interesting ex-mormon show, but appears to be defunct
 - Freethought Rhode Island - college radio show. I've heard 1 episode, might like it.
 - Geologic - musician, comedian, skeptic, atheist George Hrab. Not actually about geology!
 - Point of Inquiry - Center of Inquiry official show
 - Skepticality - Skeptic magazine official show

<p>A bunch of good ones have been mentioned but my personal favorite is "Conversations from the Pale Blue Dot".  That is the podcast of Luke Muehlhauser who runs <a href="http://www.CommonSenseAtheism.com" rel="nofollow">www.CommonSenseAtheism.com</a></p>

<p>It is philosophy heavy but much more than just your typical atheist discussions as he brings in a wide variety of guests many of whom are theists.  </p>

<p>I always think a good podcast/show has differing points of view.  </p>
