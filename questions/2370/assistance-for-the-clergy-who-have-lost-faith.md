In the past year, Daniel Dennett has appeared twice on the [Freedom From Religion Foundation's weekly podcast][1], talking about his ongoing study regarding religious clergy who have lost the faith.  

While no real scientific conclusions can be drawn from the process by which these priests, ministers, rabbis, and imams have come to the realization that there is no god due to the relatively small percentage of people who have been interviewed thus far, I have found myself struck more by the issues that these people have had to deal with in terms of actually leaving the profession of ministry.

In general terms, it would appear that there are two general barriers that the former god-believing clergy have to overcome, and they are:

1.  fear of the response they would receive from their congregations if they should reveal their newfound atheism.  While there is a degree to which this fear is mirrored in anyone who would deconvert from a religion, the clergy have an added burden that stems from an intrinsic responsibility that they feel towards their congregations as a whole, and the reaction could be much stronger, angrier, or even threatening if the leader suddenly proclaims a loss of faith.  
2.  the very practical financial question of what they would do for a living, and how they would be able to support themselves and their families if they weren't in the ministry.  It can be an extremely frightening thing to look at want ads and recognize that most of the "help wanted" signs request skills that they may not have, and, in some industries, not even understand.

It is with these two barriers in mind that I ask the question of: what can we, as atheists, do to let closeted faithless clergy not only know that there's a way out, but also to help them find the way?

This is a very kind question and reflects well on your character and compassion.

I used to be pretty religious and knew several Protestant clergy and ministerial students who lost their faith, came out as gay, or decided they didn't want to live under the behavioral restrictions their denomination required.

Based on a minister I knew who came out as gay, the Presbyterians have mechanisms to deal with this, and I would imagine most of the other mainstream Protestant denominations (Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Disciples of Christ, etc.) do as well. This guy quietly moved out of the pastorate into a staff job with the regional denominational organization, which he held for a couple of decades until he died of AIDS. I suspect they might do the same thing around clergy who lost their faith, and maybe even help them train for another profession.

Things are different with less hierarchical and less tolerant groups, like the Baptists and most Pentecostal and independent charismatic churches. There, you're pretty much on your own - there's no organizational safety net, so if you don't want to toe the line, you need to hit the road.

If the clergyperson has a good relationship with the local congregation's leadership, they can just explain they need to leave for personal reasons. The leadership will put out a "call" (church-speak for job ad), and get a replacement. No muss, no fuss.

As far as doing something for a living, ex-clergy I've known have tended to move into people-oriented jobs like selling insurance, being a real-estate broker, teaching, or counseling/psychology. But except for televangelist scam artists and pastors of really big, wealthy churches, most clergy are very badly paid; it's not something you go into for the bucks. A lot wind up far better off financially after leaving the ministry.

I would think the best thing you could do (as a non-believing minister) would be to analyze the skills you have developed managing budgets, groups, etc.  Very often the day to day administration of a parish or congregation has analogs in private life.  

Start figuring out "What color is your parachute?"  Then, while still in the employ of the congregation, you might take courses to get certified/degreed in these skill-sets.  Is there something against a minister bettering his/her skillset for the congregation?  It's a win/win, and for the scrupulous pastor, he might promise restitution upon leaving and securing a job, if the parishioners believe he took advantage of them.  

The bottom line is, nothing happens without a deadline and a plan.  If you know you "must" get out, then start budgeting 1 or 2 hours a day to be solely focused on developing your plan of escape.  It's a lot of work, but it will allow the smoothest transition.

On the other hand, you can go cold turkey, announce your atheism, and resign immediately on the belief that you have the skills and motivation to find useful work.  Sometimes chaos is very motivating. :-)

The second "issue" is a non-issue.  Any clergy that turns to atheism has an immediate and assured career in the book writing business.
