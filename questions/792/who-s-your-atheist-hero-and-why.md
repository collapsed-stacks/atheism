All right, this is the question we've all been waiting for! Though I would describe myself as the archetypal iconoclast (and I certainly don't want to be accused of deifying anyone!) and who's no fan of hero worship, I must profess to being interested in what people have to say on this subject. Who are your heroes and why?

My favorite famous atheist is **Richard Dawkins.** He was one of the first well-known "New Atheists," and he's *done* the most (writing, speaking, ...) that I'm aware of.

**Christopher Hitchens** would also qualify, for some definitions of "hero." Continuing to bash religion while he's dying is kind of heroic, though I'm sure he's also addicted to the showmanship.

Gregory House, MD. Unabashed atheist, skeptic, and misanthrope, with a quiet heart of gold. 

Well, nobody said we had to choose real people, right?

My heroine is **Ayaan Hirsi Ali**. I've read "The Caged Virgin" and "Infidel", both of which are highly recommended. She shows courage in coming out to criticize Islam.

I have to say **Sam Harris** is my hero because "The End of Faith" made me realize I am an atheist. I think I had been one for a very long time, but that book finally pushed me over the edge and helped me to KNOW it. He's also one of the calmest, most rational speakers I have ever heard.

Second place goes to **Matt Dillahunty** of The Atheist Experience podcast for teaching me how to answer fundamentalists.

I really **hate** the word "hero", but right now it has to be Hitchens, even though I strongly disagree with him on a certain number of issues (such as Iraq). The way he has reacted to his disease, and the grace and courage with which he faces it and soldiers on, never letting go of his own sense of self or his ethics, is a rare inspiration. I'm not often impressed by Humans; I tend to look more to the Cosmos as a whole for my inspiration. But Hitchens has definitely put a dent in my misanthropy.

I have a close friend who helped me come to terms with my Atheism is very subtle ways - and I really respect, and admire, his willingness to speak frankly about his thoughts and his willingness to reach out to people, even his fundamentalist parents.  Although it may seem strange, I think he would be the closest I have to an "Atheist Hero" - primarily because I have seen a personal, marked change in my life because of his influence, and a marked increase in my happiness because of him.

 - **Isaac Asimov** Not because he was an atheist, but because of his books. Gives me a different kind of hope for the future, a future with robots.
 - **Kurt Vonnegut** because he had a certain way to approach life and death that was very matter of fact.

<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periyar_E._V._Ramasamy" rel="nofollow">Periyar</a></strong>: He helped to uplift a backward, superstitious society into a modern rational society.  He was a game changer in Tamil Nadu, Southern India.  He opposed religion and related superstitious believes and rituals.  He opposed the caste system.  He advocated for reason, self respect, and women rights.  Largely due to him and his movement, Tamil Nadu is relatively one of the most economically and socially progressive states in India.  </p>

The biggest thing about being an atheist is that we don't idealize on anything. So may be we don't have a one man hero or legend. Its just atheist.  
Either atheist or not atheist. Nothing in between.
