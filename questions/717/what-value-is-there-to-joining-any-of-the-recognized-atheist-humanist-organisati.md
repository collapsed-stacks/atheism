In the UK we have the [Humanism Association][1] and I was thinking about joining. Does it have valuable benefits ? I believe the joining fee is about approximately $100/£50.  I have also seen that there is an [american counterpart][2], and I assume even more. What kind of real value do these groups provide, is it worth the fee, ultimately does it make a difference?

<p>The link you gave is to the well-known "British Humanist Association". For example there are many Members of Parliament associated with it (and Dawkins, Toynbee and others too). </p>

<p>The "Humanist Society" is the name of a more dubious for profit online forum, can't remember the link it did not take off IIRC.</p>

<p>For a list of credible Humanist Organisations around the world see the <a href="http://www.iheu.org/" rel="nofollow">International Humanist and Ethical Union</a> </p>

<p>The value of joining such organisations is that if they can point to a substantial membership they can assert greater influence on policy. Also, an organised response is usually better than a peicemeal one, especially when fighting the highly-organised power of the churches, and these campaigns also cost money. </p>
