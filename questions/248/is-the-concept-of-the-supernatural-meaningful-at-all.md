Here's my thought process.

1. A supernatural thing, by definition, does not behave according to "natural law" - the laws of physics.

2. However, the "laws" of physics are simply our best description of how things behave in the universe. When we find something which does not "obey" the laws of physics, we simply change the laws to better describe reality.

So it seems to me that the definition of "supernatural" precludes it from existing: if it existed, it would be "natural".

Put another way: given a thing which exists, I cannot think of a way to determine whether it is "natural" or "supernatural".

Is something wrong with my reasoning? Have I misunderstood the meaning of "supernatural"?
