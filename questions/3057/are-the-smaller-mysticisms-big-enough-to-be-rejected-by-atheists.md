Consider the following examples: astrology, talismans for luck, belief in ghosts, and fortune telling. I'll call them "smaller mysticisms." They share similar traits:
 
- belief in something "extra" to the physical world

- operation of a force not explained by science

- fervent advocacy of the truth behind the example by respective believer

- frequent claims of a singular "experience" that prompted belief in the example

- evidence/argument not befitting the rules of science/logic to substantiate the example

However- they do not necessarily presuppose a deity or deities. We can reject them on logical/scientific grounds. But must they be rejected on atheistic grounds?

I am interested in both the yes and no answers because both pose interesting follow-up queries:

1. Wouldn't an answer of "no" open room in atheism for supernatural beliefs as long as they do not contain expressions of belief in a deity?

2. Does an answer of "yes" indicate atheism is more than just a lack of belief in any deity. Further, wouldn't this make it a rejection of all things not upheld by logic/science?

Or, finally, is atheism varied enough to allow for both answers?
