One hears again and again, from prominent atheist thinkers, using good arguments such as Russell's teapot, that atheism is simply a _default_ position, one that best accords with the evidence.  It is a negative position, given buttressing from hundreds of facts from the sciences, from evolutionary biology to cosmology.  From such talk, one might think that discussion about atheism by atheists would be of the cool, detached sort when the subject of why so many claim religion comes up.

But, reading atheist forums, that's not what I find at all.   Atheism is made to be this monumental, life-changing discovery that sets one against believers for the "crimes" they commit.  For example, there is lots of talk, here, on these forums, of "abuse" and "coming out" -- the latter of which is a tag, where people share their personal stories.

So my question(s) is (are):  **If atheism is such a natural position to come to, and has so much evidence arrayed for it, why is this insight given so much emotional significance in the atheist community?** Richard Dawkins wrote, in the Blind Watchmaker, that "it was impossible to be an intellectually satisfied atheist before Darwin" -- but isn't it 2011 now, more than 150 years and million more facts after _The Origin_? So why does atheism as a position continue to evoke such strong emotions in some atheists?
