We live in a world.

The world is one way or the other.

It is "known" who exactly was Jesus and what exactly he did. There is no doubt. If you could travel back in time, you could witness it with your own eyes. You would know everything.

It is also "known" whether there is God or not and what exactly is he up to. You personally might not know it, but the reality is all around you, and the God either is there or isn't (or something in between).

(By "known" I mean, "although there might be no person who knows this, it is an objective fact that *something*".)

Realizing that the world around us is, and all these answers are out there, what is the point of arguing? The only thing that can happen is that you are either right, or wrong, but that does not change anything about how the world actually is. As atheits argue, God laughs at them. As religious folks invoke God, the nothingness gapes back.

I would say that this philosophy is simultaneously non-theistic and theistic. It is not the most useful one (hard to argue with it, hard to derive false conclusions from it), but it sounds both quite spiritual and scientific. I do not think it is agnosticism, as it claims neither that the answer is unknown or unknowable - it just says that you personally do not know right now, although you live right in the middle of a an actual answer - the reality. You deeply believe with all your heart - in something. If somebody tells you about their world view, you disagree with them.

Is there a name for this?
