As an atheist, and I suspect like most atheists, I've met people who are convinced that I can't be moral without fear of a Hell. And this is in the Northeast - I guess the fact that they don't come out and say so is something. I'm a volunteer EMT and consider myself quite moral - something can be the right thing to do, and necessary for meaningful human interaction, without being afraid.

I'm no Richard Dawkins - my (non-)beliefs just don't define who I am, so I typically don't bring it up unless the situation arises. After a few weeks, people are hard-pressed to consider me immoral

What do other people do in this situation? I'm not ashamed of 'staying in the closet' but I feel like there may be another way.
