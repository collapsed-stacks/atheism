Hacks, as in, ways to cause theists to behave in unusual ways, as a result of their beliefs, possibly but not necessarily to the benefit of the hacker.

Some examples I've seen include calling up door-to-door preachers and signing up your atheist friend to receive a call, or ordering large numbers of free bibles as a prank. I'm wondering if there is a site/book/twitter feed, any location that collects such hacks?
