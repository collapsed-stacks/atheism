I'm excited to see the answers to this one.  I am not asking for distinctions between individual beliefs like, "Duh!  The theist believes in God and an atheist does not."<BR>
Rather, I'm looking for distinctions in criteria determine how an atheist divides the world into things believed and things not believed...by which an atheist would be willing to say "I believe X".  What allows the atheist to say those types of "belief" statements but not make belief statements about the "G" concept. :-)
