As an atheist, how do you address the right to choose to die? There are frequently religious injunctions against euthenasia, and other moral issues that arise from similar concepts like suicide.

What specific difficulties do atheists face with end of life issues that would not arise among theists? From that perspective, what limits do you think should be placed on it? Do you see any situations in which you feel you could decide for someone else?
