There are probably two schools of thought in atheism. The first is that we need a world without religion at all, and the other is that religion is pathologically benign as long as it is kept in private. 

In which world would you think it'd be better living, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each view? Do you think that in a world without religion there will be less suffering, hatred or wars, or do you suppose that it's part of the human nature and taking religion out of the equation wouldn't have changed much?

I know that there is no concrete answer and it is subjective (perhaps it's more fitting of a community wiki), but I strongly feel that this is very relevant to the topic of atheism, especially today when many people are bothered by the outspoken atheists in the world.
