I can't find any work by Stephen <s>Henry</s> F Roberts pertaining to atheism, or religion; but, [Sam Harris claims he is the source for the following quote](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/harris06/harris06_index.html).

> I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.
>
> -- Stephen <s>Henry</s> F Roberts 

We see this quote enough that I simply want to know about its context. Where was the quote found? And, what else might <s>Sir</s> Roberts have left us?

This post was prompted by [this answer to a different question](http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/146/whats-your-favorite-atheist-quote-or-quote-about-atheism/200#200) which placed the quote belonging to Dawkins. I knew that was't right. I don't think Dawkins has ever sourced the quote though. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.
