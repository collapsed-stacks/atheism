I can't find any work by Stephen <s>Henry</s> F Roberts pertaining to atheism, or religion; but, [Sam Harris claims he is the source for the following quote](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/harris06/harris06_index.html).

> I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.
>
> -- Stephen <s>Henry</s> F Roberts 

We see this quote enough that I simply want to know about its context. Where was the quote found? And, what else might <s>Sir</s> Roberts have left us?

This post was prompted by [this answer to a different question](http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/146/whats-your-favorite-atheist-quote-or-quote-about-atheism/200#200) which placed the quote belonging to Dawkins. I knew that was't right. I don't think Dawkins has ever sourced the quote though. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

It looks like Harris got it wrong. The quote does not come from Sir Stephen H. Roberts, but rather from Stephen F Roberts. Here's what the source himself has to say about the quote (http://freelink.wildlink.com/quote_history.php)
