So, I've been reading about some people and their scary views about how the United States should be run. Here are a couple of examples:

* Rand Paul: "We wouldn't need laws if everyone were Christian"
* Gary North, Rousas John Rushdoony et al's assertion that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for atheists and "other nonbelievers"
* George H. W. Bush: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

Are these views and opinions so out of the mainstream that we can really just ascribe them to inconsequential extremists or is this something that people should be actively concerned about?

*Edit*

Josiah made the valid point that we should be doing everything we can "to sideline these people and combat them, individually, every chance we get". I agree wholeheartedly. What are the valid approaches to this?
