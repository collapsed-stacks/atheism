## Is Christian reconstructionism in the United States something we should worry about or is its influence very limited?

So, I've been reading about some people and their scary views about how the United States should be run. Here are a couple of examples:

* Rand Paul: "We wouldn't need laws if everyone were Christian"
* Gary North, Rousas John Rushdoony et al's assertion that the death penalty is an appropriate punishment for atheists and "other nonbelievers"
* George H. W. Bush: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."

Are these views and opinions so out of the mainstream that we can really just ascribe them to inconsequential extremists or is this something that people should be actively concerned about?

*Edit*

Josiah made the valid point that we should be doing everything we can "to sideline these people and combat them, individually, every chance we get". I agree wholeheartedly. What are the valid approaches to this?

It's far enough out of the mainstream that it's not something we should necessarily worry about. There will be warning signs if it starts getting bad; I don't think it is yet. When there's a constitutional amendment proposed to alter the first amendment, or overwhelming popular support...that's when we get worried.

I should be clear that I'm not advocating inaction, but it seems that atheism is growing, not shrinking, and it would take a major revival to do anything about that. To be sure, we should be doing everything we can to sideline these people and combat them every chance we get.

A few ways we can (and should) sideline them:

 - Vote against them, obviously.
 - Support atheist lobbying/political groups. They have more money and a wider audience.
 - Get their crazy quotes out there. Let people know what they're saying. Knowing is half the battle, right?
 - When people say how much they respect them, or mention something they've done, take the time to explain why they're dangerous.
 - Moderate ourselves to elicit less religious blowback.

In the light of truth, the shadows of idiocy vanish.

* Moderate Christians: "Atheists shouldn't be allowed to attack Christianity with their mean-spirited billboards."
* Reconstructionists and other right-wing Christian extremists: "DEATH TO ALL ATHEISTS!"
* The mainstream: "Umm, OK, let's split the difference and just throw all atheists in jail, together with their abhorrent homo friends."

With the preceding satire, I hope to show how extreme opinions can contribute to the consensus. By being extremely crazy, these extremists are making other crazy people look more reasonable, and acceptable. I feel the existence and activity of reconstructionists and dominionists is a real and constant problem of US society. I would advise against trivializing or ignoring them.

What to do? Well, at least in the case of the Dominionists, they have clearly announced intentions to "take back government" and replace it with a theocracy, "a kingdom of Christ" and similar crusadery. I think it should be easy enough to make sensible people realize this kind of effort is unconstitutional and seditious. Given this information, hopefully more people will push back.

It doesn't have to be a mainstream view; as long as voter turnout remains low, a committed minority can have an outsized influence on policy and law.  We've already taken some baby steps towards an authoritarian police state, and the general public is just going right along with it.  

It's not going to happen *tomorrow*, but I have to disagree a bit with Josiah; if we don't worry about it until people start proposing constitutional amendments, then we've let it get too far along.  

How to combat it?  Get involved politically.  Find candidates.  Vote for them.  Get other people to vote for them.

Considering that the US only recently emerged from a regime heavily influenced by Reconstructionism, it's pretty obvious to me that the answer is yes, we should truly worry about. 

But more important are those Reconstructionists who have thoroughly infiltrated the US military, and are now in charge of a number of extremely dangerous weapons. Access to WMD far from being as restricted as most people imagine, and when you have important members of the General Staff who hold Christian Nationalist views, one is definitely justified in feeling a little concerned.
