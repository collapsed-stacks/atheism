I ask this out of interest because I note in a globalised world both business and organised religion broach national boundaries and organise on a global scale, while we as a community largely tend to organise on a local scale.

In essence, for example, is a christian that is American an American christian or a christian American? 

Is a non believer a non believer first or a nationalist first?
