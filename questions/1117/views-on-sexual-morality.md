Generally speaking, is the atheist community more accepting of alternative sexualities than more religious communities? (eg: homosexuality, polyamory, etc.)

In my experience, due to a lack of a 'Sky Daddy is watching you masturbate' mentality, atheists are absolutely more accepting. But that may also be because the people with whom I associate are more on the Humanist side of the atheist spectrum.
