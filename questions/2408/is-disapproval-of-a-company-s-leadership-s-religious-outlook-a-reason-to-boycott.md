There is a burgeoning movement within Facebook to start a boycott of the fast-food restaurant chain Chick-Fil-A, because of their affiliation with a venomously hateful anti-gay group.  I haven't eaten at a Chick-Fil-A for years because (1) I don't approve of the religious message that the senior leadership of this company espouses: they are evangelical Christians who have made it company policy not to be open on Sundays, and (2) I don't like the taste of their food.

There are similar reasons why I don't order Domino's Pizza: the owner is an evangelical Christian who, last I heard, was trying to build a fundamentalist community in Florida (it may even be fully constructed by now).  In the case of Domino's, I find that the food tastes better from their competition as well (both national and local pizza franchises).

In the case of both of these companies, I can argue that my distaste for the food is at least an alternate reason, over and above my distaste for the worldview of the leadership of those companies (and I even concede that I may at least partially have that distaste for the food as a result of my distaste for the leadership).

But if I didn't dislike the taste of their respective food offerings, would it still be right not to patronize these companies?  How ought this rule extend to other companies take on an overly religious (and completely unnecessary) series of policies?
