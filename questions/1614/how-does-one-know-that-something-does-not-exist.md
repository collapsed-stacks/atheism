I agree that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but I submit that there is NO better way of determining if something does not exist, for things in our day-to-day life.

Ask yourself if you have anything other than 'absence of evidence' to determine 'no' as the answer to each of the following:

"Do you have $1,000,000,000,000.00 Australian dollars in a Swiss bank account"
"Do you have three legs?"
"Is there an invisible object the size of an elephant blocking your door?"
"Is there an elephant blocking your door?"
"Is your cold gone?"

If you feel that logical contradiction or impossibility is superior, please remember the premise of how you determine non-existence on a day to day basis.


It is quite the pleasure to ask a theist who recites this mantra, and then turns round and claims exorcism gets rid of demons.  How do you know that the demon is NOT there?  


Add-on 1:

I feel that I need to expound on the question a little more, because it is being missed.

The focus is on 'absence of evidence'.  It is the only way by which I know that something does not exist.  Now, that should not be taken to mean that if I show that I do not have a third leg, it conclusively shows that God does not exist.   

No, no, no, no, no, no!

I also realize that just because we have no evidence, does not mean that there isn't any.  Said so right at the outset.

I also realize that other than "I exist" there is nothing else we can know.

Given all those things, is there generally any better way (not proof, I want nothing to do with proof) than absence of evidence that we use to conclude that something does not exist?
