## How should we deal with theists who claim to know when the earth is going to end?

A lot of theists, Christians especially, have been predicting the end of the world practically since the founding of their religions.  Some of these theists are so outrageously specific, that even those who believe that the end is near consider them outrageous.

Harold Camping has incorrectly predicted the end of the world at least two times in the past and is now claiming that it's going to happen on 21 May of this year.  Although it's easy to treat his pronouncements as a joke, that doesn't alter the fact that he, apparently is serious about it.  

So, what is the best course of action for someone who claims not only that the world is about to end, but when that's going to actually take place?  Is there a way to do it without resorting to outright mockery?

I agree with CesarGon, but to add to his point, I think they shouldn't be ignored if other people are paying attention. In that case, if you still want to do something, show those people that it's pointless to listen to the theist.

In a broader sense, that's one of the best approaches to generally dealing with people with whom you disagree, but who are not open to reason. Ignore them and show their audience why they should ignore them too.

How you go about that is a different matter. You might point out that every other similar prediction has been wrong, and that there is no reason to believe it will be any different this time. You might point out how the theist has been wrong about other things (or conversely, how they've failed to say anything which hasn't been widely known, so there's no reason to believe they suddenly have privileged information).

For a different approach, if people entertain the idea and would therefore go about their life differently because the end is nigh, they should ask themselves why they aren't doing those things *right now*. This is similar to the question of what one might do if one were diagnosed with a terminal illness. The response is usually along the lines of visiting loved ones, or climbing the Eiffel tower or other special activities. If it's important, go do that now, whether or not the world is about to end! This is especially relevant to Christians who start doing good things only to avoid punishment when the world ends.

I'd say to ignore the claim, but take the people serious and help them if possible. Especially with "so called" Christians it would be rather easy to prove them wrong using the Bible.

Ignore them.

You cannot prove that something will not happen, so the effort is not worth it. If somebody goes as far as "predicting" that the world is going to end on a particular day, I don't think they will be amenable to reasoning about their beliefs.

At the same time, the mitigation measures to be taken *if* we were to believe that they are right are so complex and extreme, that I don't think it really pays.

So, as I say, ignore them.

Answer from @Cesargon and @Solus are excellent. 

Apart from ignoring them, I think a way to live as an atheist is that of adopting an approach of "Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today" (The so-called Carpe Diem sayings). It's important for atheists: what you have is your very life now, you have no afterlife (if any), and you'll end up in "eternal torture" if any of the theist were right in their damnation statements, so it's quite simple that you will need to live your life in a better way than the average theist would need to be, considering that.

As for their predictions, yes, apocalypse predictions have failed too many times to be any worthwhile readings, but they'll just keep saying "That's just my incorrect <b>interpretation</b> of [their certain book of deity]."

Offer to buy their stuff. I mean, if they think they're going to be raptured tomorrow, you can get some sweet deals. Alternately, start a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=post+rapture+pet+sitting&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">post-rapture pet sitting business</a>. Buy up their life insurance policies? The possibilities are endless.

I sold off a ton of junk to y2k idiots, and if a mainstream "zomg the world is going to end" prophecy crops up this year (there is <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-01-01/bay-area/17466332_1_east-bay-bay-area-first-time-camping">one</a>, but it's absurdly fringe. How many times do you have to be wrong before you're not allowed to predict anymore?) I'll be making a killing on e-bay. 2012 is already looking like a bumper year (Thanks Mayans!)

So put your skepticism to work.

End-timers are impossible to "deal" with.  It doesn't matter how many times they botch the date; all that matters is that they're ready when it happens.  Not if, *when*.  When the world hasn't ended on May 21st and all the people who expected to be sitting next to God are still stuck on the ground with the rest of us, most of them won't suddenly decide that, hey, maybe those gosh-darned atheists have a point; they'll just go back to their lives, more convinced than ever that they're going to be saved, and wait for the next opportunity.

The best we can do is try to limit their influence on policy and law.

Ignore them mostly. They will prove themselves wrong on May 21st, go through insane rationalizations, and either come up with a new date or simply tell themselves that God "works in mysterious ways".

Ask them how they have reached their prediction, and then use your best judgment to decide for yourself whether you can accept it. I doubt this will be the case.

Be kind if you can, imagine living your life wanting the world to end so you can go to a better place and leave all the sinners behind. I find it hard to think how wasteful that thought process must be.

Be angry that they are telling this to their kids and ruining their enjoyment of life.

If it's a Christian saying it, then the test is whether they have the gift of prophesy or not.  If they've been wrong in their predictions before, they don't have it.  If they haven't been wrong, weeeelllll ... who knows? :)

Specific dates aren't given in the Bible in any case.

But if the guy does turn out to be right, and the world does end on May 21, 2011, what will it matter to atheists anyway?  At that point, there's nothing more to do, or that can be done, right?
