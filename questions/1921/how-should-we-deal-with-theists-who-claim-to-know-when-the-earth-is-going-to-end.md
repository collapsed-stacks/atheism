A lot of theists, Christians especially, have been predicting the end of the world practically since the founding of their religions.  Some of these theists are so outrageously specific, that even those who believe that the end is near consider them outrageous.

Harold Camping has incorrectly predicted the end of the world at least two times in the past and is now claiming that it's going to happen on 21 May of this year.  Although it's easy to treat his pronouncements as a joke, that doesn't alter the fact that he, apparently is serious about it.  

So, what is the best course of action for someone who claims not only that the world is about to end, but when that's going to actually take place?  Is there a way to do it without resorting to outright mockery?
