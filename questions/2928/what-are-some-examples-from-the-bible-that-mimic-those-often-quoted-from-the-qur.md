Over and over I hear about how the Qur'an teaches people to kill infidels; my rebuttal is that the Bible isn't exactly unicorns and rainbows. What passages in the bible are just as bad as ones from the Qu'ran, referring to killing infidels, etc? 

Specifically I am looking for verses from the New Testament (since, you know, the Old Testament is old and all).
