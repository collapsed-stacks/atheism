Okay, this is related to [this question](http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/35/how-to-deal-with-insidious-religious-people), but this time, it's not about some stranger, but about your family.

All of my family (yes, all of them) are very religious people, some of them actively working in the church. Over the past 10 years, I separated myself more and more from their religious beliefs and am only now truly considering myself an atheist.

This separation however lead to the inability of me to talk to them on most subjects of matter: philosophy, politics and social discussions are taboo.

Now how could I make clear to them that I don't share their beliefs, and start being able to talk normally to them again - without pissing them off too much and putting them on defense?
