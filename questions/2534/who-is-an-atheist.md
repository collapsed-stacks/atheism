I have been wondering for sometime now about where I fall when it comes on to my beliefs.
I know there must be characteristics that define an atheist since there is no organisation that I could join for it. So my question is, what makes someone an atheist, and how different are they from agnostics (Who to me are just people afraid of admitting they are atheist)?

Oh, and please do not tell me they are just people who do not believe in gods.
