Recently I came across [Carl Sagan's Cosmos video series on Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/cosmos) and was blown away. It really cemented my views of the world. Had I watched it as a kid it would have helped me explain my atheist viewpoint much better.

What common influences can cause one to be come an atheist?
