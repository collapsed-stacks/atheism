Christianity specifically: Since god is infinitely loving and forgiving (so long as you repent prior to death), how can one justify his tendency to send his own creations off to eternal torment.  On top of that, give god's omniscience he would be knowingly creating countless souls knowing they will be simply damned for eternity after living.  Is there an argument for how this is not a sick thing for an all-powerful being to do?
