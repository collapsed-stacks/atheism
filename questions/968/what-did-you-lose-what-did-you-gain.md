Many people paid significant prices for the change in their beliefs but, also found unexpected gifts. For me it ultimately cost me my wife, the person I believe was my "soul mate", but I gained a chance to be free of guilt and learned to accept personal responsibility for my life.

What did this change cost you? What did you gain?

When you begin to think rationally you lose a lot of gullibility and gain an appreciation of life as it really is.  With rationality one begins to think critically and not take things on face value.  When you realise this is the only life you are going to get, you live it.

Wow. That is a lot to give up and you have my respect. I slowly evolved into my Atheist self and lost nothing I only gained. I have to remember some times that People have a lot to lose.

It makes me to be solely responsible for all my actions. My life is my on choice. That can make me to do things rather than believing that some one (God) will help me to do or something like wise.  
But why to publicly announce that you are an atheist? Just live life to the fullest. No boundaries imposed by religion. Live the way you want. Religion actually restricted me in many ways (which I regret). My Grandma is an atheist.
