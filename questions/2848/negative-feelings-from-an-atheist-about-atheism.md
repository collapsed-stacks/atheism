I have read many answers and comments in this exchange that profess to the extreme effort required to reject the pull of theism or of the intellectual maturing required to do so. For myself, raised in a religious home, I cannot remember ever having a belief in God. Disbelief came easy. It seems that at earlier times in my life my struggle was the opposite- I tried to convince myself out of my atheism. I am curious as to what others truly believe. It seems to me that faith is the struggle and perhaps we have given up. To turn this into a question- Do these negative feeling not make me true atheist? While I fit the definition- I deny the existence of any deity - I feel like I still hope. What are the origins and then ramifications of this despair in atheism? Am I alone?
