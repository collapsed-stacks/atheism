A standard question deals with the bad things things that happen to people and often this leads to a conversation on the justification for a belief in God, but I wonder about the good. There are many reasons for bad things to happen, but what about the good? To tie-in to the standard question, how does this inform one's (dis)belief in God?

Because there isn't some supernatural being out there watching everything we do and changing our fate.
