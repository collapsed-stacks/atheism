As a marginalized, unfocused minority, Atheists need to ask "How can we gain the respect and acceptance in society which all humans deserve and eliminate the prejudices and stigma attached to being an atheist?"

The homosexual community succeeded (and still continues to fight) in achieving societal acceptance, involvement and power by using the following tactics:

1. Organizing and getting politically involved in advancing common interests.
2. Coming out, to put faces and names to the group targeted by bigotry.
3. Taking pride in identity... celebrating.
4. Insisting on equality... not "special rights... but EQUALITY.
5. Re-branding (gay) and/or claiming and owning negative labels as their own ("We're here, we're queer, get used to it.)

So, should atheists follow the model of the Gay rights movement?
