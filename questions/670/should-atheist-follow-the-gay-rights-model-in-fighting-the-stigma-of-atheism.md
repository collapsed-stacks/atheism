As a marginalized, unfocused minority, Atheists need to ask "How can we gain the respect and acceptance in society which all humans deserve and eliminate the prejudices and stigma attached to being an atheist?"

The homosexual community succeeded (and still continues to fight) in achieving societal acceptance, involvement and power by using the following tactics:

1. Organizing and getting politically involved in advancing common interests.
2. Coming out, to put faces and names to the group targeted by bigotry.
3. Taking pride in identity... celebrating.
4. Insisting on equality... not "special rights... but EQUALITY.
5. Re-branding (gay) and/or claiming and owning negative labels as their own ("We're here, we're queer, get used to it.)

So, should atheists follow the model of the Gay rights movement?

There has already been some attempts at a gay-rights-like movement, like with _[The Brights](http://www.the-brights.net/)_ and Richard Dawkin's _[Out campaign](http://outcampaign.org/)_ but there hasn't seemed to have been much traction so far. 

The atheist's plight may have some things in common as with that of homosexuals but is usually confined to religiously charged parts of society, particularly in the politics of some countries. At least in the west, atheism isn't all that demonized.

I think that we should band together to fight any faith-only government initiatives, such as favouring religious people and organizations, including within the military. We could also use more public education with respect to morality as being independent of religion (e.g., [secular ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_ethics#Secular_ethics_and_religion)).

In a lot of places, coming out as an atheist isn't as big a deal as coming out as gay. Where there **is** considerable oppression of atheists, like in highly religious communities, we should support those who want to be honest and open about their beliefs there.

Personally, I don't find any labels for atheists with supposed negative connotations all that problematic. Being called a _heathen_ for my non-beliefs isn't any more hurtful than being called a _honkey_ for being whiteâ€”it only shows the small-mindedness and futility of whoever uses those words. I don't feel that calling myself a _bright_ or an _infidel-and-proud-of-it_ is all that impressive, but then I've been an atheist for over half my life without much hardship for being one.

How about an _It Gets Better_ project for new atheists?

I think that the answer depends strongly on where you are and what your culture is. Maybe if you live in a place where religion is heavily imposed upon people and atheists are pointed at and demonised (no pun intended), then the approach that you suggest may solve some issues. But in other places and cultures, where religion does not play such a big role in the daily life of people, labeling oneself may not be that important.

I seem to infer that you are talking from a US-centric perspective. My cultural and social environment (northern Spain) is very different, so there you are: I don't think there is a universal answer to your question.

In any case, I don't mean that we should abandon activism or accept the *status quo* just because the pressure against atheism is not that bad. I am all for activism. But I think that, depending on cultural and social characteristics, there may be different better approaches to spending one's energies.

<p>Yes and No.</p>

<p>The two movements do have certain things in common: notably the idea of "coming out". They also have differences. One important thing is to learn from the mistakes of the early gay rights movement. They were racist. (Not deliberately and overtly, but practically.) And that bit them. When women or members of minority groups speak in atheist forums about feeling left out, unrepresented, and uncomfortable, as does happen from time to time, don't be quick to be defensive. Listen. Learn.</p>

<p>PZ Myers and the Pharyngula horde pretty good at this these days. Jen McCreight writes about the intersection of atheism and feminism.</p>

<p>And, of course, there's the ever-excellent Greta Christina, who has written more than once on "<a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/02/what-can-the-atheist-movement-learn-from-the-gay-movement.html" rel="nofollow">What Can the Atheist Movement Learn from the Gay Movement?</a>"</p>

You're assuming that being an atheist is stigmatized. According to wikipedia 37% of all Belgians consider themselves atheist. In fact, with all the child abuse stories it's the roman church that has been under heavy criticism these past few years.

And are gay people really fully integrated? Here in Belgium they can marry. Can they in the US?

I don't think the tactic of forcibly "outing" people as gay (against their will) was ethical. I'm glad that this specific tactic has not been adopted by atheists. 

But in most ways, I think the gay rights movement had a lot of success and is a good one for atheists to learn from.

No.  
God/higher being not existing (atheism) is as much a theory, as God/Higher being existing (other relgions).  
Being Gay is 100% definately provable.
