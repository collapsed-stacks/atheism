What particular pre-modern cultures are there that were totally devoid of religion - no gods, no spirits, or anything else?

No.

Religion is superstition, and all early societies were riddled with superstition and mumbo-jumbo.  When the craziness became codified enough it became religious dogma.  Mankind is just now emerging from this long dark age.

The closest I could find is [this](http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090412-ENTERTAIN-904120305).

So, a missionary went to convert an Amazon tribe however he deconverted himself and became an atheist. If you read the text though, you'll notice that the tribesmen do believe in some kind of spirits. But it's far off from standard religion and more a kind of primitive superstition.

I don't think so. There may have been societies without formal doctrines of belief but they still believed in supernatural authorities and the worshipping of them.

I don't think there is any conclusive evidence of that.

Heck, I don't think there is any conclusive evidence of modern or event post-modern societies that are _totally_ devoid of religion.
