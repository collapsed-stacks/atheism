## How is this possible disproof of God's existence by argument from varied gods?

The definition of deity varies from religion to religion and culture to culture. It seems that if we have an idea that has such wide and often incompatible breadth, it is natural to question if such an idea is based in reality in the first place.

I'm going to propose a hypothetical and ask its implications:

 - It most cases the varied Gods of man are anthropomorphic. At the very least they are ascribed some form of consciousness akin to human awareness (though perhaps far broader.) In slightly fewer but still many cases they are seen to have human form (eg- references to God as he/she) 

 - So lets say in the near future we encounter extraterrestrial intelligence. They are at least as intelligent as man and display similar social constructs. Assume they share similar theistic/atheistic polarities in their culture. 

 - Would not the clear contradiction of an anthropomorphic/alienomorphic God (just made that one up) be enough to prove that such a singular being could not exist? 

A deep implication of this question is the idea of God seems to be limited by the ideas of man. To see limitations on God from a completely non-human source might just be enough to limit the concept out of existence. 

The base question is: Would the discovery of non-human intelligence dispel all current notions of God?

No.

You are not dealing with rational and logical people.  They do not *ever* step back and look at the source material in a new light given new evidence and evaluate it anew.  Not ever.  In fact, even the notion of doing that is anathema to them.

Instead, the only question they ask is. "How does this news fit inside my existing framework.  Is it good?  Or is it evil?  Is it God? or is it Satan?."  Etc. - To use a christian viewpoint.  The discovery of non-human intelligence would simply provoke a search in the bible (or name your book-o-silliness) for obscure references that could be interpreted to mean whatever the predisposition of the preacher happens to be.  If he's xenophobic, whic would be very likely, then he will miraculously find the exact quotes to fit the understanding that alien intelligence is against god's plan for man... or something.

No... no, you're barking up the wrong tree to ever think that news and reason will alter primary belief.  Instead it's just a challenge to belief that has to be overcome.

" Would the discovery of non-human intelligence dispel all current notions of God?"

Unlikely.

The key is that on this world we have no objective proof that god exists.
Any other world without objective proof will just enlarge our undestanding of the universe.
If you are a believer in god such a discovery SHOULD also enlarge your understanding of god.

No.  While gods (plural) are usually anthropomorphized, this doesn't apply to God.  While some people are convinced that their holy book says God is like they are (holy books frequently wind up saying exactly what the person quoting from them would like them to), most people are aware that God is represented in some ways because people representing God want to represent God somehow.

Plenty of religious people are more or less expecting to find extraterrestrial intelligence, and expect it to believe in God.

(Do not assume that religious people are stupid, or even irrational.  They have beliefs that you do not, based on several possible reasons.  Do not assume that you know what their beliefs are.  Frequently, atheists ascribe religious beliefs that only a fairly small minority of religious people subscribe to.)
