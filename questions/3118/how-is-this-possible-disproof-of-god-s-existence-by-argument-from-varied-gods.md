## How is this possible disproof of God's existence by argument from varied gods?

The definition of deity varies from religion to religion and culture to culture. It seems that if we have an idea that has such wide and often incompatible breadth, it is natural to question if such an idea is based in reality in the first place.

I'm going to propose a hypothetical and ask its implications:

 - It most cases the varied Gods of man are anthropomorphic. At the very least they are ascribed some form of consciousness akin to human awareness (though perhaps far broader.) In slightly fewer but still many cases they are seen to have human form (eg- references to God as he/she) 

 - So lets say in the near future we encounter extraterrestrial intelligence. They are at least as intelligent as man and display similar social constructs. Assume they share similar theistic/atheistic polarities in their culture. 

 - Would not the clear contradiction of an anthropomorphic/alienomorphic God (just made that one up) be enough to prove that such a singular being could not exist? 

A deep implication of this question is the idea of God seems to be limited by the ideas of man. To see limitations on God from a completely non-human source might just be enough to limit the concept out of existence. 

The base question is: Would the discovery of non-human intelligence dispel all current notions of God?
