I use the word "congregation" to mean a group of people who are united based on their faith, but share much more than that - typically social, political, and economic support and aid, amongst other things.

Are there any groups which provide similar sorts of support and experiences, but without the requirement for explicit statements of faith? Are any of these groups popular within the Atheist community?

The local [Houston Atheist meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Houston-Atheists/) is a great example of a vast social network that is plenty capable of supplanting even the biggest southern congregations. Keeping in mind congregations are usually local, (denominations are regional with many congregations). With over 1,050 members the Houston Atheists have their own 

* Bowling subgroup (unholy rollers)
* Lecture group
* Church watching subgroup
* Book subgroup
* Weekly social meetups more localized for the North-East North-West South-East, South-West, and Central areas.
* Games subgroup
* Monthly meets that cover the whole city.

They typically have one or two events every *day* in some part of the city. With 61 schedule events on the calendar right now: including a TRON 2 showing, and New Years Camping.

I'm not exactly sure what this question is over. And, I'm not exactly convinced that you wanted to target something specifically. Just wanted to throw out a very localized answer.

While Houston is the biggest, there are a [ton of these types of meetups](http://atheism.meetup.com/).

There are numerous skeptical, humanist, freethinker, atheist and agnostic groups across the United States - some local, some national. Googling <your city> <any of the above terms> will bring up different atheist groups in your area. 

While these groups don't have a particular faith, it's much like a congregation in that people come to discuss ideas, form friendships, and create the psychological support networks similar to what religious congregations would establish as a result of their faith.

I find Americans United (against church & state ) to be a good community of people who support a common ground and cultural identity (atheist v theist) is not an issue whatsoever.

Although this is a US group, I recommend it as finding an atheist message or issue can be a good ground for integrating atheist thought into society at large.
