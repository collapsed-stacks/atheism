I use the word "congregation" to mean a group of people who are united based on their faith, but share much more than that - typically social, political, and economic support and aid, amongst other things.

Are there any groups which provide similar sorts of support and experiences, but without the requirement for explicit statements of faith? Are any of these groups popular within the Atheist community?
