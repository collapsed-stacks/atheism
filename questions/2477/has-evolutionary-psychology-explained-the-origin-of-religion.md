I have seen several evolutionary-psychology based attempts at explaining the existence of religion, with various dependencies on genetic tendencies. 

What I wonder is:

1. How strong is the evidence, if any, for such explanations?
2. Are there any equivalent explanations for Atheism?
3. Is any research group currently taking one or more of these hypothesis seriously, and investing both time and money into researching their validity?
