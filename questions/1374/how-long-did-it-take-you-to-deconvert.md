(obviously this doesn't apply to anyone who has never believed in a deity)

I grew up in a passive religious environment - everyone believed in God but nobody went to churches etc. But when something fortunate happened people genuinely attributed it to God, and in tough times people genuinely hoped that God could help.

Of course these ideas got deeply imprinted into my mind, and although I had always believed in things like evolution and always thought Bible was inconsistent to say the least, I still found that when things were bad I was secretly asking God to help, in my mind, and when things were good I was secretly thankful to God. ("secretly" only in that I never spoke about it to anyone, for no particular reason).

At one point I decided that this was totally inconsistent with my fundamental beliefs and decided to try to eradicate this last bit of religiosity out of my mind. But, it was HARD! It took about two years of conscious effort to _not_ be thankful to God, and to _not_ ask God's help. It was initially a little scary, even :)

Anyway, as I say, I think it took me about two years before it stopped even occurring to me to be thankful to God or ask God's help, without forcing myself and without feeling uncomfortable about it.
