You can try the <a href="http://www.epicurus.info/etexts/epicurea.html">Epicurae</a>; it's a collection of fragments, mostly. You hardly get anything complete from the ancient greeks, doubly so for heretics like him. The only reason there is anything at all is that he was wildly prolific, and widely quoted.
