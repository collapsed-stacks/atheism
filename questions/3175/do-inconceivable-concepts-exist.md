When arguing with theists on God's nature, I'm often facing the following answers: "God is not subject to time", "He is of inconceivable nature and therefore can't be fully understood by man", "God's ways canno't be understood by man" etc.

I admit it's pretty comfortable for a theist to say that questions he canno't answer are beyond man understanding of the world. 

However, from a logical and rational point of view, do concepts beyond our understanding exist? If so, how can we rely on logic and reason to decide on God existence?
