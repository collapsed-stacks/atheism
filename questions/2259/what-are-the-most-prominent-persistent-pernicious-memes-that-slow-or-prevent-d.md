This is intentionally designed to build a list (CW), and have the "memes" voted up/down to determine what ideas constitute the biggest obstacles to a religious person abandoning a belief.

For purposes of definition, "religious thinking" is a mindset resistant to evidence, filled with circular logic, and favoring preservation of dogmatic tenets over discovery of "truth" about how the world works.

Please only include one "meme" per answer.  If you feel the idea needs explanation, do so.  I'll start with two answers below to seed the activity.

KEY:  Keep focused on what the IDEA is behind the believer's claims.  What is the thinking planted that allows them to make the claim, and which is always defaulted to in times of stress.

**If you have an example of scripture or any other religious teaching that supports a given meme, please add it to the comments for that meme.**
