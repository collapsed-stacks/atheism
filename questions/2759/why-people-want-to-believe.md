Hi guys :)

Across the world and the centuries people venerate their gods, looks like they need it, something is empty without it.

Some religions do good things, but why animal sacrifices ? Why subjugation of women ? Why preconception of social classes ?

I believe in God but I don't need any religion to know what is wrong and right. So, being good or bad, why people want to believe ?

Thanks
