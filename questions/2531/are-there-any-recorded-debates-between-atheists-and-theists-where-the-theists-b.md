It would be interesting to me to see whether the debate will be significantly different when a major component of the beliefs of the theist side is switched around. Are there any such recorded debates available for me to see?

The answer depends on how the question is phrased. I am not personally aware of any debates between an atheist and an individual who believes in a god and that their god is malevolent. If such a case could be provided, that deserves the bounty.

However, there are plenty of recorded debates between atheists and individuals who believe in a god that is *clearly* malevolent, but said individuals claim the god is actually benevolent. Usually this is seen within Christianity and Islam. 

For an example, see this famous clip from a debate between Richard Dawkins and Dr. Mohamad Mukadam. Dr. Mukadam professes a belief in freedom of Religion, then agrees that, yes, the punishment for Apostasy as dictated by Holy Law in Islam is death.

@hiroprotagonist I cannot say this with authority but it sounds like Calvinists (like the Phelp's) fit your description.
