Usually, various religions try to "forcefeed" people with their beliefs and give you flyers, build temples, etc, to gain followers and prestige.

If you don't believe in a higher power, you are usually discouraged from doing the same.

In addition, there isn't such thing as an organization (though that's fine, who would want a non-stamp collectors guild).
