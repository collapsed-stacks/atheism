Even amongst my friends who claim to be atheist, quite a few of them don't regard Buddhism to be a religion and see it as more of a "way of life/guide to life".  Personally I believe that it's as full of ritual and superstition as any other religion and the above claim can be made for any of them.

Curious as to what the members here think about this.
