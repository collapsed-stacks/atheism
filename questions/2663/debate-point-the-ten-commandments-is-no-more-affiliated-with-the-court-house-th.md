The [Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause_of_the_First_Amendment) has the following verbiage:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

However, this mandate is not abundantly clear enough, on its face, to have religious artifacts removed from a court house -- especially if they've already been funded. Even if it convinces a judge or jury it isn't convincing to many Christians. I often hear a defense of displaying the Ten Commandments in a Court House on the grounds that the mere presence isn't an endorsement. This often starts by claiming that those that want The Ten Commandments removed are construing "presence" for "endorsement". They usually end up concluding that if you make the same construal in other areas; i.e. the US "endorses" Dell, the US "endorses" BIC, and the US "endorses" Ford Motor Co.

I've got a defense with an analogy that I just used on a podcast and it worked rather well. I'll post it after I field some input. How would you counter this in a debate? Let the fun begin.
