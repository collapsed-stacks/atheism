Recently a Christian told me,

*"You only accept evolution because everyone in science does. If you were to disagree with it, they'd throw you out, and your papers would never be published."* (They even mentioned Expelled, the film.)

Now I was about to point out how stupid this argument is because it can be flipped around by replacing "evolution" with "Christianity" or "creationism" or even "religion", science with "the church" and "papers" with "religious writings." But I wonder if anyone else has any response to this?
