Let me start off by saying - I am still an Atheist. But there was a point, very recently, when I thought I had changed my mind. I am curious to know if this ever happens to some of the other very 'strict' Atheists. 


So oddly enough, I became an atheist about 1 year after regularly participating in church. I was about 8 years old, and from then on I've pursued science. 

I've read so many books, listened to so many podcasts, radio shows, all to further my understanding of evolution, nature and the psychology involved in religion. 

When I lost all 4 of my grandparents, whom I loved dearly, not only was I not even slightly swayed to consider the notion of a god, but I also skipped out on the funerals because I knew they would be religious, and I don't know how to answer the condolence, "She's in a better place now."   

However... on November 14th, 2010, my mother died at age 44, alone in her bed. She was a drug addict and we hadn't spoke in about 6 months, but she had tried to contact me over and over again. She made a lot of mistakes but she always loved me, greatly. 

But I digress. When I lost my mom, something snapped inside my head. I found myself drawn to believe that she was "Still here" and "Watching over me". I even asked out loud at one point for her to show herself. 

I know now it was just the throes of grief and denial. But it made me see that, even the strongest of non-believers can be led to believe in the face of tragedy.

When Darwin lost his daughter, he said that he hoped there was a Heaven. 


So has anyone else come close to sacrificing their non-beliefs in a hard time?
