What are some good science documentaries that could make children interested in science, critical thinking, and perhaps atheism?

I think the series "Cosmos" with Carl Sagan still stands the test of time.  It certainly helped me to think and question, and remains a primary motivator for my world view.  I can't wait to introduce it to my children.

Have a watch of Brian Dunning's free online video "here be dragons". Magic.

Richard Dawkins 1991 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled 'Growing Up in the Universe', were based on his book 'Climbing Mount Improbable'.  As with all the annual lectures, they are aimed at school children (although much loved by their parents too). 

In them Dawkins introduces the fundamentals of evolution whilst encouraging critical thought and questioning dogma.

I just remembered what made me a critical thinker or at least moved me in that direction. My mother sometimes reviewed books on math and gave them first to me in order to save her time (I was about 13 years old then). Of course I wasn't able to find all mistakes and misconceptions, but it was a help anyway. This way I learned to think of correctness and consistency of what I'm reading.

Mythbusters. Hate to go "simple" but this takes science and makes it fun. Science SHOULD be fun, it's REAL magic!

"Planet Earth", "Life", those sorts of nature documentaries always go over well with my kids.
