To be more specific, I converse with a fundamentalist Christian person on a regular basis, and successfully made them watch and read numerous evolution-related videos and books (to name just a few, *First Life* and other series by Sir David Attenborough, *Why Evolution is True* by Jerry Coyne, selected articles from Talk.Origins, etc). The problem is that the person was taught to pretty much ignore anything that hints at evolution as an established fact. When explicitly inquired about their evolution-related thoughts of the TV series or book they read or watched, the Christian admits that the explanations are plausible, but says they *feel* that *something* is wrong. So, is there any efficient psychological technique to deal with that?
