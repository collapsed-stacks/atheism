Hi

I'm curious what other atheists doing when they are facing a bad life situation where religious people turns theirs minds to god and finds solace in their belief.

Can't speak for other atheists.

For myself, I turn to friends and family when possible.  When not, I just muddle through on my own.  I rely on, and find solace in, my own strength and determination.  

Sometimes I just swear a lot.

I try to find a solution or alternatives way-outs or i think of something else and do something else (play games,watch television etc) most times the situation goes away.

I lean on my family and friends for solace.

I research the crap out of the problem and try to find both information and possible solutions. Having information, and having both a plan and a backup plan, helps me feel a bit more in control. 

Swearing is good. Swearing in German and Klingon is great &mdash; all those fricatives. :)

It's hard to speak for all atheists, but I (as an individual atheist) do several things:

 1. Try to figure out if I can change anything about my circumstances which would improve the "bad times."
 2. Use my social circle: turn to family and friends for help/advice.
 3. Try to focus on the positive aspects of my life (i.e. the things OTHER than the thing that's bugging me).
 4. If all that fails, and so far it has not, then I would consider seeking professional help (i.e. motivational speakers, personal counselors, etc.).

Turning to deity in case you fall into bad times is a bit like taking a drug: it doesn't really solve your problem, it just masks it and the problem remains. The main issue is that when you don't solve the problems they keep building up and if the only solution to your problems is to turn to a deity, then you'll end up in a vicious spiral: you'll keep accumulating more and more unsolved problems, you'll keep turning to your god and you'll never get out of it!

I seek out solutions to the situation.  What do I have to do to make it better?  Can I do it alone or do I need to rely on friends and family for help?  Can any catharsis be gained from talking about it on internet forums?  If it can't be improved and it just *is*, I have no choice but to accept it, however grudgingly.

Remind yourself that things change, you never know what good things might happen in the future. Imagine how you would advise someone else in your situation, to approach the issues. Take control where you can, to make things change or to improve the situation.

The best way is to cry out in private and put a bold face outside and be thick skinned.Atleast I do that.

I try to help others with their problems. I find that when I think less about myself, and more on how to better the world, my problems don't seem as a big as the potential good I can do. Plus these empathetic feelings give me a bond to my follow man. We are all in this together- we all feel pain; and in knowing that I am not alone (through my empathetic feelings) I find solace.
