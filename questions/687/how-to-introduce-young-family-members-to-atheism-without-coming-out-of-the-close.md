I have a young nephew and niece, who are growing up in a Muslim country. Their parents are somewhat religious, not radically so, but they do say the prayers, fast, read the quran, etc.

I can't come out to my family about being an atheist, they largely see me as a non practising muslim, and I'd like it to stay that way. However, I'd like to start introducing the nephew/niece to critical thinking, pointing out that having doubts about Islam is nothing wrong, and tell them that such things as 'atheists' do exist. 

What would be the best way to accomplish those things without spilling the beans about being an atheist?
