I have a young nephew and niece, who are growing up in a Muslim country. Their parents are somewhat religious, not radically so, but they do say the prayers, fast, read the quran, etc.

I can't come out to my family about being an atheist, they largely see me as a non practising muslim, and I'd like it to stay that way. However, I'd like to start introducing the nephew/niece to critical thinking, pointing out that having doubts about Islam is nothing wrong, and tell them that such things as 'atheists' do exist. 

What would be the best way to accomplish those things without spilling the beans about being an atheist?

In my opinion, don't start teaching them that Islam is bad/wrong, or about atheism. You can tell them that different people in different parts of the world believe in different things, thus opening them to the possibility that Islam is not the only way.

But better, explain to them the wonders of life and universe, the everyday natural life. Children are fascinated by stuff like that. Tell them how observations, testing and experiments demonstrate evolution. How physics can create galaxies, stars and planets. Teach them about facts, by asking questions and directing them to the answers. Make them part of the thinking process.

Here's a relevant quote from Climbing Mount Improbable (ch. 8) by Richard Dawkins:

> I WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE with my daughter Juliet, then aged six, and she pointed out some flowers by the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn't true.

I am positive that I heard him tell this part in a lecture, and then continued that he explained to his daughter some basic principles of evolution, and why flowers are "pretty" and have strong fragrance to attract bees and birds to help them reproduce. But unfortunately I can't seem to find the quote.

I also agree with @Nomad, but to simplify... my mantra that I try to pass to my children is "think and question".  
I was raised in Texas, so I had a fairly religious upbringing, but luckily my parents encouraged me to think for myself: Ironically they probably had the biggest part in turning me away from religion.
Anyway, it seems my kids are responding well to my "think and question" attitude and I'll probably continue this until they get old enough to start asking the really hard questions.  Due to the season here in the States, my son just asked me about Santa Claus and I said "Well, does it seem possible that a guy could do what he does in a whole year, much less than one night?  What do you think?"  I am starting to see the gears turning in his brain about it.

This is not a new idea, BTW.  Many books on skeptical parenting out there have the same ideas.

Science books, games or whatever catches children's imagination now. Too bad Bill Nye isn't on anymore. Nothing you can do will have more effect than them learning about it on their own, if you can get them to.

I had books as a child that explained scientific phenomena in ways children could understand, I loved those books to death. My grandmother also bought me a huge science book when I was young. I don't think she realized how much impact that book would have on me. The covers have fallen off, and it's pretty torn up, but I still have it. I bought the same book for my nephew for his birthday last year for the same reason you're asking.
