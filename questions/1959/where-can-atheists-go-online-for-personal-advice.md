While this site is not well equipped to handle advice questions related to atheism, it is clear that this is a needed resource. Are there any good advice sites existing for atheists? I see that there are a lot of websites that offer advice, I am more interested in a site like a forum where people can get personal advice.

Please leave separate answers for specific resources so we know what we're voting for.

<p>I'm tempted to set up a website. :-)  </p>

<p>But for now, you can try <a href="http://www.askanatheist.org/" rel="nofollow">"askanatheist.org"</a> or go to 
The Friendly Atheist's website, and submit a letter to <a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/category/richard-wade/" rel="nofollow">"AskRichard"...</a>  He's overwhelmed, it seems.  Appears there are a lot of folks seeking advice.</p>

I tend to like http://friendlyatheist.com/. Hemant is a teacher and does a good job at being a kind of atheistic Dear Abby...
