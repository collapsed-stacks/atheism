I was a agnostic then a critical thinker then I became an Atheist. To me it was a logical progression. I listen to every Critical Thinking and Atheist podcast I can and there seems to be lots of Critical Thinking groups that dont want to be associated with Atheism.

so Why does 'critical thinking' not always lead to Atheism? Does this matter?
