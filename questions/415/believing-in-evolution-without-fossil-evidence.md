Is it intellectually honest for Dawkins to proclaim that without a single fossel in favor of evolution he would still believe in it all the same? Personally, I find this and like claims bizzare; and, I keep hearing them more and more. I've also recently noticed that this point has poped up in [this debate with Ray Comfort and the Rational Responders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgm2cdibdhA).

I believe you should expect fossels! The amount of them sould be a function of the environment of the species, and the size of the population. I think we're not off either: we've got fossils. To say that you *don't need fossil evidence to believe in evolution*, is not the same as, *if fossilazation didn't exist, in its entirety, I would still place my belief in evolution*. Are these people confusing these two statements? Or, do they really mean what they're saying? Would it be correct to say then that if genetics didn't cohere with evolution, belief would still be maintainable? At what point would the lack of evidence predicted by the theory disqualify its conclusion, and its utility?

I'm just confused at why debating *atheists* would want to proclaim that even without the evidence that the theory predicts, they'd still believe in the theory... Sure, genetic evidence is more valuable and the case is stronger and better preserved in the genes, but does that mean we should ignore a hypothetical false-prediction? It also seems to be at odds with popular claims for the theory's disqualification: which many jokingly place at a [rabbit in the Precambrian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precambrian_rabbit).

Lastly, doesn't this at the very least play into hands of the theists and cause a bigger problem? It seems like you're framing the scenario as if you no longer want to put stock in fossils, and that the theory is less evidentiary and, dare I say, faith-based.

So in essence,

* Am I understanding these statements correctly?
* Would the theory of evolution be maintainable if both fossilization was maintainable, and no evidence was found?
* Is this something that should be repeated in future debates? Or, should we try to avoid this take on it?
