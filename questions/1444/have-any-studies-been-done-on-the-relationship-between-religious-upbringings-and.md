I just read about a serial killer from the 80's named Ridgway, and I was surprised to learn that he'd grown up in Salt Lake City. It seems his childhood was tormented by the type of mother many people who come from particular religious backgrounds complain about. As such, it seems to me that perhaps the best case to be made against religion is 'it can produce some really nasty people.' But have any studies been done?
