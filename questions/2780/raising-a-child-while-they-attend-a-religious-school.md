My 5-year-old has just started going to school, and after looking at all the schools in the area the one that we believed would give the best education was a Catholic school.  This means he will be attending church, saying morning prayers etc.

What do people think is the best way to encourage some critical thinking about what he's doing?

<sub>Note: I don't mind him actually attending church and so on, it'll be an education.</sub>
