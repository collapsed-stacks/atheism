There are several properties most deities have, e. g. omnipotence and omniscience. The mentioned properties are mutually exclusive, because if deity knows he's going to reduce Sodom and Gomorrah in ashes he already cannot change his mind and not abandon the cities, or if I quote R. Dawkins:

> If God is omniscient, he must already
> know how he is going to intervene to
> change the course of history using his
> omnipotence. But that means he can't
> change his mind about his
> intervention, which means he is not
> omnipotent.

The other paradox is "Could an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that even that being could not lift it?" Certainly, it couldn't.

Are there any other interesting paradoxes on deities' properties?
