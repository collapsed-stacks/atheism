The one thing I just can't comprehend about religion is when a rather intelligent person is theistic.

Scientists tell us a ton of **really weird** things about our universe that we pretty much take on authority:

 * Time is relative and events aren't simultaneous for everyone
 * Space can bend
 * Particles can ["teleport" through "walls"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling)
 * Electrons behave as if they [fly through two slots at the same time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit%20experiment)
 * [Some particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) can fly through all of Earth as if it wasn't even there

etc. The people I'm talking about do not deny any of these - in fact, usually strongly support these ideas. Even though none of them actually performed even the simpler experiments to actually confirm these (I sure didn't).

Additionally, we believe scientists when they tell us that **there isn't something**, despite the commonly quoted fact that non-existence can't be proved:

* There is no [luminiferous aether](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether)
* There is no [phlogiston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory)
* There is no [caloric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory)
* There are no unicorns

These smart theists support these ideas too.

And yet, people who are otherwise very smart, rational thinkers, and take all of the above on authority with no problem, go ahead and **completely disregard the conclusion that there is no god**; a conclusion given by the same people who propose some rather more weird and yet accepted ideas than the non-existence of god.

Why do smart theists do that? Double standards? Very strong indoctrination? Fear of not believing?

<sub>For the pedantically minded, when I say "there is no X" I mean that we estimate that our chances of being wrong about this are very, very low. I'm also not talking of anyone who rejects the above scientific ideas - I can see why someone who rejects these might also believe in god.</sub>
