If prayer is to work there has to be some properties associated to its transmission to the deity. Even if you attribute it to 'just magic' then that magic must still have properties in the magical realm, if not the physical realm. What are these properties and are they detectable? 

This transmission, in the case of standard 'half-duplex' prayer seems to be the reverse of ADSL in some respects; there seems to be more bandwidth for uploading than downloading.

Full duplex prayer, where the prayer-user can receive as well as send - is rarer by all accounts.

I have heard from some prayer users, that when they get together for prayer that it is more powerful. This would suggest that prayer does have physical properties. If amplification of prayer-band or P.B. transmissions can be attained by grouping synchronous transmission together, then what other strengths and limitations are there?  P.B. Reception seems to be improved by kneeling or holding together of hands. This may indicate some grounding plane reception issue.  P.B may have been impressive 2k years ago, but these days, skype is much better quality and does not suffer from the same vagaries as P.B. The voice quality of Skype is excellent in my opinion, where as P.B reception seems rather hit and miss.  Why does God not use Skype? Or God hash tag?  

Seeing as there are so many religious people still around, if He would embrace modern technology he could improve communication with his followers and also raise money for some of his charitable work by SMS reverse billing or pray-as-you-go plans.
