For nonbelievers there is obviously not much sense in having a time of reflection about our belief in a god. Still, can’t Lent be also a time of constructive self-examination without a belief in a deity?

I have a few friends (some of them non-religious) who practice various forms of abstinence during Lent and I am very uncertain how to parse their behaviour; I am alternatingly torn between incredulity, annoyance, and grudging respect.

By the way, I don’t mean by this that we should be fasting, giving up our favourite food for a time. But rather that we try *in general* to take a step back from our usual life and re-examine what we take for granted.
