I often find myself debating a lot with friends who are firm believers in astrology. I am a skeptic in all kinds of supernatural phenomena, including astrology, so I try to refute their claims to the best of my ability but I can never seem to get through them. 

The precise point I want to refute is that **celestials bodies influence people's behaviour**. 
However, when I argue that there is no evidence of this, the conversation often turns into an anti-science discussion (science cannot explain everything, some things are best explained without science, scientific evidence is irrelevant to astrology, and not having evidence doesn't prove that astrology is wrong).

Does anyone know around that problem?
