My daughter is about to start attending the 1st grade in a public school in September and I'm not sure how to deal with the unconstitutional pledge of allegiance of 1954. 

On one hand I do not want her to say the words **"under god"** on the other I also do not want to burden her with additional stress of immediately standing out in what will be already a very stressful time. 

The most reasonable option seems to be to just tell her to skip those words and thus effectively recite the pledge of 1924 but would like to hear other opinions.

Emotionally, I would really love to finish what Michael Newdow started in 2004 and get this all the way to the supreme court knowing that this time the court will not be able to get away on technicality (noncustodial parent) but I do not have neither the time nor the resources for such a fight... nor would I want my daugher to get caught into everything that would result from such a choice which is not her own...
