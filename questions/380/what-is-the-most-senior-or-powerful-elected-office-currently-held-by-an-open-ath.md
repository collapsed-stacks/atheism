I'd actually be interested in multiple answers, by country or region.  I know this is similar to the question about being elected as an atheist, but what I'm interested in is specific examples of open atheists in office right now, if there are any.

Former prime minister of Belgium [Guy Verhofstadt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt) is an atheist, as he admitted when invited in a talk show on Belgian television ([Nooitgedacht](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nooitgedacht_%28televisieprogramma%29)). But being prime minister of Belgium may not be considered as a very powerful position. ;p

I also think [Zapatero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero) is an atheist, but I'm not sure. It says agnostic on his wikipage.

Mazie Hirono is listed as a Buddhist, but I'm pretty sure she has publicly stated that she is "non practicing" and basically atheist. While searching for that I came across Ted Kaufman, also a US representatives, although the jury is still out on him.
