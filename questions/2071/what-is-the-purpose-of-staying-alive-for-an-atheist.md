If I was an atheist I would think

* Probably there is no spirit
* In this case when the man dies, it's for good
* Probably I will die someday
* Nothing I have done will affect me after I'm dead
* There is no permanent reward or punishment for what I do
* Why should I live?

How do you answer this to yourselves? What's the meaning of life?
