## Has the New Atheist movement really tried hard to grapple with what drives people towards religion? If not Dawkins et al., who?

The nascent atheist movement, the New Atheists or "Brights" as some of them call themselves, seems to just keep chugging along.  For example, although doubtless we atheists continue to be persecuted, Dawkins' 2006 book _The God Delusion_ has sold more than 2 million copies,   Hitchens' 2007 _God Is Not Great_ more than 300,000 copies, and Sam Harris' _The End of Faith_ more than 145,000 copies to date.   That's a lot of dinero for those guys to continue in their battle with the forces of irrationality and superstition.  Hurrah!

So it seems a lot of people are reading these books, and getting a worthwhile message out of them.  Nevertheless, I can't help but think that despite the prodigious number of words they've penned recently, the New Atheists haven't done a great job at grappling with what keeps people religious.  Many of them refuse to engage the frightening ideas that keep people afraid of a purely naturalistic outlook (which again, I possess.)

For example, although Dawkins made his scientific name in evolutionary biology, he seems awfully wish-washy to me when it comes to actually applying its lessons to human beings:   

 - You won't get a straight answer out of him, for example, if you ask if <a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf">there could be racial differences in intelligence</a> caused by evolution.  
 - The New Atheists never talk about what is implied if there are hereditarian differences in say, moral capacity between human beings, or what should be be done if rape is an adaptation, <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/evolutionary-psychology-for-the-masses/">as some biologists think</a>.  
 - What if "evil" is mathematically hardcoded into the universe, as it seems to be when recessive homozygotes get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease#Genetics">terrible genetic diseases</a>, or sexual conflict might be because of the differential fertility between males and females?   

These things just fall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle#Derivation">right out</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_conflict">the equations</a>!

Here's my point:  If some questions are so terrible to contemplate, that highly regarded scientific magazines like _Nature_ <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7231/full/457786a.html">will publish editorials</a> asking for the banning of research, why is it "irrational" for the religious to <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=NIV">shield</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:24&version=NKJV">themselves</a> from these same <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/is-there-discrimination-in-science-against-women/">terrible questions</a>, in their roundabout way?
