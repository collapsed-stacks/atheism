Say there's proof that we exist in a deterministic universe--or that impossible, proof that a deterministic universe indistinguishable from ours must exist in spite of any supernatural cause, like with a computer simulation<sup>1</sup>--would that constitute a final proof of the nonexistence of any god?

Reasoning goes: if deterministic, then the universe is isomorphic to a number (that is, you can represent the state of the universe as an integer--however enormous that number is), and God is not necessary for the integers to exist. Also, if deterministic, then no supernatural entity outside of the system can intervene and change the course of events in it.

1 - The computer simulation would not be the cause of the proof-universe, but proof that such a universe can exist.
