I have heard anecdotes from Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett referring to current preachers who are in fact closeted atheists. I have also had the pleasure of talking to one former preacher, Dan Barker, who indicated that there were many more like him. There appear to be others as well (some have books, as it seems to be an interesting topic).

I'd like to know of any former preachers that are now avowed atheists, but in particular the most famous ones.
