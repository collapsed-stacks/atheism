Every religion has its own absurdities. For me, the following story from islam ranks pretty high:

> Sahih Bukhari Book 071, Number 614: 

> Narrated Abu Said:
> A man came to the prophet and said, 'My brother has got loose motions. The Prophet said, Let 
> him drink honey." The man again (came)
> and said, 'I made him drink (honey)
> but that made him worse.' The Prophet
> said, 'Allah has said the Truth, and
> the abdomen of your brother has told a
> lie."

Or this one:

> Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 54,
> Number 536: 

> Narrated Abu Huraira:

> Allah's Apostle said, "Once while a
> prophet amongst the prophets was
> taking a rest underneath a tree, an
> ant bit him. He, therefore, ordered
> that his luggage be taken away from
> underneath that tree and then ordered
> that the dwelling place of the ants
> should be set on fire. Allah sent him
> a revelation:-- "Wouldn't it have been
> sufficient to burn a single ant? (that
> bit you)
