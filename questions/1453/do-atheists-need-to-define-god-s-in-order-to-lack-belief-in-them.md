It seems that to say that you either believe in the nonexistence of some thing "X", or do not believe in the existence of some thing "X", that you need to have a good idea of what X is in order for these claims to make sense. This seems to hold no matter what X is. If I lack belief in the existence of blickets, you would ask what I mean by blickets, and then upon analyzing that definition, you would respond in one way or another. Without that explanation "blicket" is an empty word.

Then does atheism require defining the kind of thing that a god would be in order to not believe in it or believe in its not existing?  In the same way, without such a definition is "God" equivalent to "blicket"? Then, what definition of god do most atheists agree on? Or alternatively put - what are the features that a god would have? Is our ability to discuss this dependent upon the more uniform definition of "God" present in a Christian heavy Western society?
