Given that atheism is generally defined as the lack of belief in God (or deities), and that the reason for this lack of belief is generally, according to atheists, the lack of rational evidence for the existence of God, are there any circumstances under which such "rational evidence" could be established, verified and accepted?

To put this more plainly, if God presented himself one day (in those terms as God is described in monotheistic religion), how would an atheist approach the issue of establishing whether the appearance and/or actions of this God rationally prove that it is indeed God and that God exists?
