I've always valued truth above other things and it's hard for me to imagine that other people wouldn't.  There are masses of otherwise intelligent people who really believe in absurd things like the resurrection of Jesus, Noah's Ark,  Adam and Eve, Abraham and Isaac, and Jonah and the Whale, yet many of these same people would outright dismiss modern day claims of supernatural events or the myths of other religions on grounds that they're preposterous. Is there no consistency in their logic?  There are clearly motivations stronger than reason and evidence that compel theists to believe in weird things.  I wonder if any of these motivations could do the same to atheists.
