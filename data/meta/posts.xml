The answers to many questions are a persons personal convictions and not always easy to voice in definitive terms. I also think that there is an avoidance to stating a definitive answer that appears to speak for the whole group.

Atheism is not like this; atheism is a position that one takes, but is not a field of knowledge. That's why it cannot generate large numbers of questions for which clear answers exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leaves us here: either we admit that this kind of very subjective question, which is almost a discussion point rather than a proper question, is fine; or we abandon the idea of having a StackExchange site for atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to prove me wrong, please provide 10 or 20 sample &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; questions about atheism that we haven't seen before.

If I make something, and someone criticizes it, I should be comfortable defending it as well as improving it (even if it is just to try to add clarity).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lack of a good faith effort to write good questions seems to be in question here.

However, if a question is closed by 5 of your peers there is obviously something inherently wrong about it. Closing a question is a way of formally requiring someone to edit their question so that it can be improved (whether it was subjective/argumentative, or because it wasn't clear what was being asked).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we circumvent this mechanic we do an injustice to the community.

Does anybody have any feedback?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The media enjoys the revenues of a good shock story about a shocking work of art involving theism or atheism. As with any other polarizing conversation, the two are not served by fanning the vitriol. Atheists and theists are better served by art works that can motivate them to a better understanding of the others' perspective and keeps them from talking past each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What kind of a dialog, or it's phrasing, successfully engages both atheists and theists in works of art? Are there specific themes, or perhaps ways of pulling together a work that will make it one that challenges atheists and theists in such a way that there is communication between the two? How do successful art works differ from the works that break off conversation and cauterize both camps?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An interesting example of an attempt at dialog between the two camps was when the displays of Damien Hirst (atheist painter/sculpter) and Bill Viola (works about martyrs and saints) were put up in St. Paul's Cathedral. It was a dialog opportunity for everyone willing to be silent for a few minutes while they absorbed the work. Many of the religions and other social groups solidify and expand their influence by engaging in cross-belief dialog; what do successful works have that challenge both groups to understand the other, rather than simply repulse ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;some comments: &#xA; - I seek agreeable areas of art (the shared language) that can engage atheists and theists alike, and challenge them to understand the other, rather than simply repulse. For instance, the entire history of medieval art is based in devotional works that are compelling to even the most secular of observers. High-relief carvings in naves of demons were meant as proselytizing mechanisms for illiterate peasants. This is a tactic that today is interesting and food for discussion to both camps for its over-the-top nature.

For example, if someone asks, “I set up a web server at home but I can’t access it from work,” it’s OK to rewrite the question as, “What things should I check when a web server running at home is not visible on the Internet?” In fact, sometimes selfish, stupid questions of the “do my homework” variety can be easily edited into a form where the answer will provide an extremely valuable resource for the internet at large.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t answer questions that have already been answered elsewhere&lt;/strong&gt;.

Simply redefining what is meant by &quot;Atheism&quot; is within the purview of that community.

Chat rooms and schedule chat sessions can be a big help here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think a good way of considering how to annex some brainspace is to not think of the annex  as modifying our site by simple addition, ie &lt;code&gt;Atheism &amp;amp; Blah&lt;/code&gt;. Instead we should have some multiplicative addition; a way of taking our topical knowledge and making it more pointed, more practical, and ultimately more meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As a first step, vote up this question if you think a scope change is in order. Remember, this is not an idea meant to just add content with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; Blah&lt;/code&gt; to atheism, but is meant to add context to each and every question asked. It's meant to broaden the scope of what questions about Atheism mean in a practical sense.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, let's try to brainstorm some ways to make the Atheism site broader in it's impact, not just its libraries. Try to think of practical edges to add to atheism. &lt;strong&gt;Post individual implementations as answers below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try to POST 1 ON-TOPIC, &amp;amp; 2 OFF-TOPIC EXAMPLE QUESTIONS a la Area51s process&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third, we can have some scheduled chats, etc (as Robert recommends) as necessary, but we should try to build a consensus for how we would like to add focus to our site.

I have seen what I considered crazy atheist viewpoints too, such as Jesus being based on Horus or atheism being the point of view that humans are born with. There is a lot of mileage we could get out of that discussion once we handle all the philosophical arguments for god and what not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think most atheist discussion forums are setup so a few angry people dominate and chase away the occasional theist who comes along wanting to try out their latest argument. So far, I think this format is keeping that under control pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the above from Gunn could be put in wiki form, with a little more clarification, and if a question is too broad, ask to clarify if they are talking about religion in terms of a specific belief, or as &quot;ultimate concerns&quot; in general, or as the social experience.

I was quite surprised that it was in beta, because opening such a site seemed almost completely antithetical to the philosophy the StackOverflow people espoused.  It seemed absolutely setup for failure, and upon reading the site metrics, and clicking through, I was confirmed.  I thought I might offer a couple of thoughts on why this site is an ill-advised idea, at least in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, this site isn't attracting any experts, because of two reasons:  The aggressive and gang-like mindset of many of its participants, and because it's impossible to be an &quot;expert&quot; in atheism -- it's a negative position!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the most serious, and the least rectifiable.  New Atheism, the movement,  has changed the tenor of atheists to define themselves oppositionally to theists, their mortal enemy and their persecutors, to whom they must be ever vigilant against.  Right now, I have 2 views on one of my questions, with 1 vote to close, and no comment -- most likely because to some in this community my unorthodox views smell like those of a &quot;theist troll.&quot;  Although it should be pretty clear I'm quite disdainful of atheist activism, I'm not the only one to notice this aggressiveness, and a few voices on meta seem to have already piped up against this increasingly fractious trend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is structural, in that atheism, as a negative philosophy or position, cannot have experts.   The difference between here, and a productive StackExchange, like Math.SE, where I'm most active, could not be more clear: There, a good user can turn a sow's ear into a silk purse; bad questions can still have remarkable threads because mathematics is explicitly constructive in a extremely well defined way.  Here, a bad question just stays a bad question, or worse, becomes flame-bait, because atheism as philosophy is NOT constructive, it's completely agnostic as to moral precepts and values.   One might import various moral theories into an atheistic worldview, but then we'd be talking about a Philosophy Stack Exchange, wouldn't we? The discussion level there would be higher, but even there keeping up with constructive questions would require staying abreast of the field in the most esoteric journals, it would be quite difficult... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best Stack Exchanges, to me, seem to have this quality where responses can be constructive despite bad questions, or limited knowledge:  &quot;Hm, A.&quot; &quot;I can't answer that, but can answer A/2, which is quite similar...&quot; or &quot;Wow, that is a really bad question B.  In fact, B offers a pedagogical exercise in what not to do in related situations C, D &amp;amp; E...&quot; &quot;Really bad B actually occurs as the result of an obscure history....&quot;  Etc.  They invite specific and targeted questions, and experts to give good answers, because of their explicit constructiveness.  Atheism, as a subject matter, lacks that quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be hard enough that Atheism StackExchange were non-constructive in this way, even without all the belligerency...but with it, there's just little hope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1095" LastEditorUserId="1095" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-02-17T02:09:08.960" LastActivityDate="2011-03-01T07:59:53.683" Title="Is this site attracting experts?

The unfortunate truth is that philosophy - which is what most questions are about - is a lot harder than they realize. Whole books are written about the philosophy of religion. It's not a topic a layman can claim to master without first doing a lot of reading. Otherwise, he'll inevitably use many arguments that have been demolished decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to the second point, it's quite clear that &quot;atheism&quot; is too limited of a subject. There are so many interesting questions that go beyond that scope. that's why it has been suggested to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/268/&quot;&gt;merge with religion or philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. Both would be far better suited. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atheism, alone, is too much of a limited position. It's not metaphysical naturalism or any other coherent belief.

We have banned part (religion) of the topic (atheism), which is integral to discussion, as off-topic. Focusing on the topic is less on task than focusing on the endeavor of the inquiry. There is an unacknowledged subtext to all questions about atheism that does not exist with cooking or superuser'ing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a minimalist/reductionist definition of atheism being used to define the scope for questions, and it is killing the content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not posting to promote my prop on Area 51, however I think that there is an umbrella topic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/29214/comparative-thinking-belief-knowledge-systems?referrer=nKAzd1fMMiMOKYl-gzfdoQ2&quot;&gt;Comparative Studies&lt;/a&gt; (encapsulating Philosophy, Religion, Atheism) that would better allow standards and content for questions to more distinctly emerge. Atheism on its own is too truncated a view of the topic. Semantics aside, I do not believe atheism is a negative position for many people who subscribe to it insofar as it constitutes a building block of their identity. However, to talk about it without discussing what it is defined in contradistinction to (or to assume that any question involving religion is likely off-topic) is far narrower a view than any real inquiry of any topic would allow. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/q/634/5985&quot;&gt;My proposal seeks to unify this realm of inquiry (Philosophy, Religion, Atheism) under one heterogeneous community&lt;/a&gt;. In my view, the other two (and most species of religion generally, but not 'Biblical Hermeneutics') will fall into the same gambit where there are 1 or 2 other topics that are integral to the discussion, but off-topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For atheism at least, only through the merger of all three of these topics can we set a context for exploring what is both (a) a very scholarly, expert-populated field of study, and (b) a difficult-to-contain-as-&quot;good subjective.&quot; What is missing (why this seems un-constructive) is a context, a setting for the Q/As over-arching discussion. By excising Religion from the site and fixating too doggedly on just atheism, perception of the historicity and lineage of this study has languished.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am always comfortable having my questions criticized. However, there is a default &quot;there is no atheist answer&quot; reply that many people use. For people who believe that the community of atheism is faceless, I feel they are missing an entire component of the inquiry. To not accept that atheism is a choice and creates friction in one's sense of identity is absurd. To close questions because they deal with trying to reconcile theist issues with an atheist perspective seems, on its face, like not facing issues or telling people to shut up. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is less to do with applying atheism to the stack exchange model as it is to not allowing questions to borrow from related topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2011-02-17T14:59:57.860" CommentCount="2" />

Three potential issues with this solution are, (1) changing people's habits, (2) questions spawned from other questions are quite likely to be seen as too similar, and closed as such, and (3) sometimes a back-and-forth debate is the only option for addressing a particular point of contention.

These guidelines are from a while ago and some of them are more open after use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I listed religion, science, and philosophy as off-topic was to try to have an intellectual boundary; where we could point and say, &quot;we're not the experts on that, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I think that in terms of religion and philosophy in particular, an atheistic perspective is valuable and something people would want (if just to share and have evaluated). Also, as those stacks have yet to develop, I think it would not be out of place to exercise and share the philosophical and religious knowledge that atheists do acquire. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of science, if it is about theoretical physics, guess what, there's a stack for that. Point them there. Same thing with biology. If it is about evolutionary psychology, that's a bit of a gray area. Not because there aren't better experts on the subject, but because atheists would be enriched sharing that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am approaching scope from the type of content, rather than the subject of the content. Basically, I propose two qualifications for broadening the scope:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;the content presents...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value added: the question is pertinent to a current discussion in atheism, and although it may be tangential to the discussion, the knowledge is generally applicable to atheist knowledge. I.E. The discussion on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_of_religion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;evolutionary psychology&lt;/a&gt; (in the question &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2793/is-theism-a-predisposition/2838#2838&quot;&gt;Is theism a predisposition&lt;/a&gt;?&quot;) contributes a theoretical response to the common question asked of atheists, &quot;If there is no God, where does morality come from?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity in atheism: many of our questions seem to be seeking some definitive answer. However, this kind of expectation of a community as diverse as each individuals deconversion story is unrealistic. We are going to have a stack that is more discussion-y than English Grammar and Usage. That doesn't mean questions cannot demand methodical answers; that doesn't mean answers don't need to show their (critical thinking) work. We should allow a question and answer to dwell more in the '&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;good subjective&lt;/a&gt;' than in the objective; and we should be more strict regarding any dwelling in the '&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;bad subjective&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The two concerns I have opening the gate to these two allowances have nothing to do with lowering our standards on the questions/answers (if anything, we need to be twice as rigorous). My concerns are these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incessant nitpicking: My first concern is that we will feed the bug that insists on creating these mammoth threads in the comments of an answer. I personally find myself distracted by these at the minimum, annoyed and aggravated on bad days. Imagine we had some notable like Hitchens stumble on the site and post an answer, do you think he would stick around if we quibble over every nitpick? Yeah, so cut it out with everyone else. This isn't cooking where bad advice is might end in a case of botulism. You know what works for that kind of discussion? CHAT. Thats what it's for. Go &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. (...and if you have some 12 comment thread, and the person makes the edit you &lt;em&gt;needed them to make&lt;/em&gt;, then delete your comments.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inevitability of &quot;Inconsistent Enforcement&quot; QQ: Yeah. We will be inconsistent at first: it will get better and standards will be more formalized. But remember, (a) closing is not permanent, (b) all questions can be re-opened, or asked better. Even the best question or answer can still be better with a collaborative effort. The issue bigger than over-closing, is over-answering. Answering bad questions frequently  makes editing questions to be answerable almost impossible. We can occasionally harness the motives of one subjective, vote-to-close-bait question and edit it into an objectively answerable question. Answers on bad questions make editors feel sad. Editors honestly don't want to orphan your answer; also, editors don't want to deal with QQ'ing about how your answer was so great for the original question. If you answered a bad question, and it was edited into shape, you'll want to adjust your answer to fit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'm less worried about backlash than people being discouraged and &lt;em&gt;not trying to work to forge the framework&lt;/em&gt;. It's our shared community. The community determines what flies, so test the boundaries. Try asking the same question a different way if it is closed. If you realize some way of incorporating content that was initially off-topic, share it so that we can codify the what and the why.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nobody is out &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to close questions, or on the prowl. Everyone knows we have a severe lack of content. Closing questions is not a productive solution. Nobody wants to close a reasonable question. BUT Sometimes, when you play the tape to the end, you notice that there are flaws that need corrected about a question. Closing a question is meant to keep people from putting up good answers to bad questions before there is a chance to rectify the flaws. Please try to promptly correct flaws or clarify questions when they are posed of your question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2011-02-18T14:55:43.510" />

More members than I expected have some sort of idea of what it means to have crossed a border into atheism from where they can speak clearly about it. I don't think that border is so clear, regardless of any simple definition. People who have come to terms with it personally, frequently have a community, a family or even a spouse who has not. I think the ASE format can supply a format to have those discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A step down from that, are those who are not quite ready to declare themselves atheist. If you aren't aware of the many paths to getting there, take a look at &quot;50 Voices of Disbelief&quot;. If atheists are more open and willing to accept someone who is &quot;on the path&quot; toward atheism, I think we will find more people participating in the discussion. Churches have been doing this for decades and it has helped them maintain their coffers. I am suggesting a much less subversive way of this doing this. Churches accept members who are &quot;on the path toward Jesus&quot; and give them plenty of room to not believe in miracles or participate at whatever level they want, hopefully showing up on Sunday and dropping something in the basket of course. This can be anything from a conservative church that focuses on abortion, to a liberal church that sings protest songs from the 60's and rarely mentions Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Q &amp;amp; A, this would mean opening up to someone who says they are not religious for reasons X, Y and Z, but they had a vision once, or a dream, or felt something, or read some website about quantum physics etc. and they want to ask a question about it. Sometimes these types of question may sound more combative. I see these people on the Atheist Community of Austin with Matt Dilahunty, and he almost gets them to see where they are self-justifying or fooling themselves, then he starts laying into them and saying the Bible is completely wrong and ranting about it and he can't see why they can't get it. There are plenty of sites to rant, and I don't need to be linked to &quot;Why is Greta Angry&quot; anymore. If that is what you like, then go to a site that likes that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we can reach a happy medium on all of that, then I think we can have better discussion about what is part of human nature and what is imposed on us by an insidious power structure that has reproduced itself across generations. I have the same fear that Nietzsche did, that if we just say &quot;God is dead&quot;, without looking at what that means, will it just result in a nihilism? Question like that, mixed with question about god's existence, and what to do for Christmas can make for a rich and interesting site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;edit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2848/negative-feelings-from-an-atheist-about-atheism&quot;&gt;Here is an example of something that I can't say I have ever seen on any other atheist site.

And how is this different from the belligerence of the religious exhorting us to convert lest we go to Hell and burn for eternity? Or holding 'God hates fags' signs? Is it just that we're used to seeing this from the religious, and pass it off as just expected religious fervour, but we're not used to seeing it from the non-religious/godless?

There are bound to be loose interpretations, or connotation based uses. For Anti-theism to be properly on-topic it needs to meet two standards: academic rigor first, social appropriateness second. Content that does not meet the following criteria should be flagged, and questions should be closed as &quot;Argumentative &amp;amp; Subjective&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Academic rigor, the usage must meet the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-theism is not personally antagonistic of theists necessarily; as a position it is at most &lt;em&gt;adversarial&lt;/em&gt;. Consequently, usage of Anti-theist argumentation directed toward theisTS is off topic and should be flagged. Disguising rancorous or condescending talk as thoughtful or well-researched shows a lack of respect for the community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anti-theism is not a sentiment, it is not a feeling. Proper usage contains the specific &quot;doctrine antagonistic to theism; 'denial' of the existence of a God; opposition to God&quot;; further, &quot;To be clear, 'opposition to God' is not in most meanings a statement that an anti-theist believes in a deity but opposes the being, but for various reasons the position that it would be bad/immoral for such a being to exist.(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-theism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anti-theism as a concept is used as an indicator of antipathy for belief in theism.  &quot;The concept allows a distinction to be drawn between the simple indifference or apathy towards theism, atheism, or agnosticism (cf. apatheism)... Antitheism has been adopted as a label by those who take the view that theism is dangerous or destructive.(&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-theism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anti-theism, in a literal usage, can be used in a fashion to ask about activism as an atheist (strong atheism is a part of anti-theism, and anti-theism ties into secularism very frequently). When considering whether Anti-theism is being appropriately used in this fashion, ramp up the standards for the question itself: &#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did the question-asker make it very clear what the problem is? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Did the question-asker make it very clear how to provide good answers? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does the question give a tangible context for the question, or are they asking a general question that applies in all manner of situation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of social appropriateness:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal attacks are not accepted on any other stack, this is no exception.

(Hint: the 4-6 paragraphs also leads to TL;DR syndrome)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoid adding anti-theist flair. Some humor is acceptable, but condescension (especially toward the question-asker) is absolutely unallowable.

God created us as part of a bigger plan; we are all infused with God's spirit; there is an absolute right and wrong; I am going to heaven; etc etc. As someone stated, a person with these beliefs is trading in their intellectual honesty in exchange for comfort and a perceived purpose to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atheism is supposedly a break from that self-deception. We value intellectual honesty above a false sense of purpose. But is that really true?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one example - to many people, one of the most offensive things that a theist can say to an atheist is that you can only be moral if you believe in God. As atheists, we are quick to reject that notion and prove that morality really comes from social norms and religion has merely adopted the same values (mostly), not dictated them. But there's always that implied and unquestioned agreement that we should be moral.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, if you want to be intellectually honest all the way down, you have to recognize that there is really and truly no higher purpose to anything, which means there is no such thing as &quot;should&quot;. We are here as flukes of evolution, we will live out our lives, and we will be gone. Whether people are kind or unkind to each other has only fleeting and small-scale significance, at best. More realistically, it has no significance whatsoever. In fact, the existence of the entire human race might be over in nothing but a brief moment of evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it seems that even atheists are still stuck in the pattern of trying to find significance and purpose where there is none. Bleak as it may be, the reality is that there is no purpose. If we choose to pretend that there is so that we can live &quot;productive&quot; lives, we should at least recognize that we're doing it for those reasons. Assuming of course that we really do value intellectual honesty. To me though, it just feels like the Matrix, where a few people are intentionally allowed to &quot;escape&quot; in order to foster the belief that they have beaten the system and thereby keep the system going (ignoring, of course, that the last Neo was a true singularity and really destroyed the Matrix, which I thought ruined the story). We have shed one layer of intellectual dishonesty - that our purpose comes from God - but still cling to a lower layer - that we still have a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But why does anything matter? Why should someone who understands that there is no higher purpose waste time and energy adhering to social norms, trying to be &quot;good&quot;, etc? The normal response to that is - by being a good citizen and friend, you create an environment that is better for yourself. By why does that matter? Why should I be happier with lots of friends and money than I would be as a lonely bum in an alley? Or rather, why should I care that I would be happier. And yes, society would fall apart if everyone thought this way, but you already know my answer - so what?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The honest answer is that it doesn't matter. I would experience some &quot;discomfort&quot; as a bum in an alley, but even that is not a &quot;bad&quot; thing. It's just my brain trying to induce me to avoid a situation that reduces my chances of spreading my genes, because that's what it has evolved to do. But the only reason I try to spread my genes is that I have evolved to try to spread my genes, nothing more. And yet, none of us stop trying to live &quot;better&quot; lives. The social and genetic programming in us is much too strong for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to the title question - are we really being honest to ourselves? Or does being atheistic help give us a false sense of being &quot;intellectually honest&quot; and allow us to avoid the question just as effectively as theists do? And is this especially true for those of us who were formerly religious and now congratulate ourselves on having broken free?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(And I fully recognize the double hypocrisy inherent in even asking this question, and in doing it anonymously. If I truly believed that it didn't matter, I wouldn't have bothered, right? So yes, I am as guilty as anyone in finding it hard to let go of my own self-importance.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2011-02-24T18:08:46.970" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-02-24T18:08:46.970" />

For that reason it was closed. I don't believe that anyone particularly argued the case; but it's in their FAQ, their site is flourishing, [gawd] bless them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/36/philosophical-discussions-about-skepticism/39#39&quot;&gt;I argued against that case&lt;/a&gt;. While he called it &quot;philosophical&quot;, I consider analysis and critique to be, dare I say methodical and &lt;em&gt;skeptical&lt;/em&gt;. At any rate, there is a middle ground to be held. There are questions which are too general, and general questions which apply to analyzing or critiquing method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An inherent difficulty with creating a general proximity agreement over this middle ground is that in order to evaluate method, all persons must agree to the ends of said method. For skepticism, they might say they agree on the end being reaching the most neutral, objective truth on the matter at hand. With atheism however, the end is not so well defined; individually, much less collectively. To say there is a particular purpose to atheism is like saying there is a purpose to not collecting stamps. Maybe its to free up time for collecting marbles, but that's not really a motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The closest thing to a &quot;method&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; is that of proving that [gawds] do not exist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion (I'll leave it as opinion) that this question is too general. It does not cut into any atheist model, that is, it does not seek to disprove the existence of some [gawd] or to undermine theist argumentation to the contrary. Insofar as claiming [religion has x impact], as we are neither comparative religion experts nor history experts, we are either unqualified to answer the question or the answer is off-topic anyway. Insofar as we ask what methods we use to analyze their impact, even on the most specific example, we are engaging in sharing interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~~~&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I think your question is about method&lt;/strong&gt;. It is about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to perceive the impact, &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to connect the ley lines from historical events to the religions' actions of the time. This is a question &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; history and religion, and although a question of consequence to atheists, it is not currently a question about atheism in particular or its methods. For me, to be critically and constructively about atheism and its methods, it must do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It needs to focus on a specific event (possible time period), and how to draw consequences from it &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These consequences should &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/349/is-anti-theism-a-valid-topic-for-this-stack-exchange/357#357&quot;&gt;support an anti-theist perspective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; adversarial to a theist position that would otherwise expunge or ignore the impact of a religion on the event.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;i.e. &quot;What role did the Catholic Church have in the Holocaust? Was it complicit in mass genocide?&quot; (Note: This question allows for both sides to answer and give objective responses. It is &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; argumentative and objectionable, and possibly not permissable, but if good answers can follow from more refined versions, it might actually &lt;em&gt;draw more people&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why the &quot;Was Hitler a Catholic?&quot; question (or however that was posed) was on-topic. Churches seek to affiliate themselves with their best, and disassociate themselves with their worst. Setting a specific purpose to the question would turn it around; it would give meaning for anyone interested. It could be filed under &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/debate-points&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'debate-points'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;debate-points&lt;/a&gt; or we could come up with a new one like &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;churches-gone-wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, this might light up the switchboards on new questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, does this answer the question currently posed? No. However, I don't think the question is answerable. Follow-up: Should it be community wiki? Maybe, and that would change some things. If we repurpose the question, it can serve as a living repository for how different atheists think through these matters. (BTW: I am not one to actively suggest we should &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; a CW, I generally hold out hope the question can be refined. This might be the best exemption of that rule ever though.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I am having a difficulty composing a suitable, spelled out, example question that doesn't sound heinous.

Like any mass-identity group, churches seek to affiliate themselves with their best, and disassociate themselves with their worst. These questions are for &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;churches-gone-wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Caveat: I am having a difficulty composing a suitable, spelled out, example question that doesn't sound heinous. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;My primary concern with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;churches-gone-wild&lt;/a&gt; question, is that if we end up with a massive amount of them, they could devolve into horrible, horrible scapegoatings, stone-thorowings, and peeing in soup. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The only way of putting that in check is to use examples where there is some explicit denial on the part of a possibly culpable religion. Again, an example that comes to mind are abortion clinic bombings? I don't know, obviously this is not good or prime for front page yet, but refinements can be made once we start. Obviously this cannot just be about traffic or feeding the hate-ier sides of our egos (I, for one, do not want to participate in hateful games); but an active effort at bit by bit debunking denialism of the churches seems like a fair motive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/q/399/135&quot;&gt;More discussion of the CGW and &quot;Impact of Religion&quot; question can be found here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2011-03-16T19:10:52.587" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-03-16T19:28:47.513" CommentCount="5" />

I hadn't much ideas about &lt;em&gt;selling&lt;/em&gt; the side, so I didn't.
