This is not an answer to that question but a clarification of the word &quot;beliefs&quot;; its usage in this sense is ambiguous as it can be construed to refer to any number of variously held beliefs. (I.E. &quot;Beliefs&quot; is ambiguous as it can refer to facts or faith and no one responding to the question would know which to correctly respond to.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many questions use terms whose ambiguities make definitive answers nearly impossible as they lack specificity.

These two terms are often considered synonymous with strong and weak atheism, respectively. [I'm not sure this last bit is completely accurate. I'm a strong atheist, but consider myself an agnostic.

When you are a biking nut or a software developer, specific questions pop up into your mind a dozen a day, and a Q&amp;A site like this is a perfect place to find answers. I don't think atheism is like that, because atheism is not a hobby or a trade. It is a position, a stance, a philosophy. And, as such, it generates intricate debates rather than to-the-point questions that can be answered with straightwforward replies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless, of course, we want this to become a site where people come to find beanies. ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, I think that we shouldn't expect this site to be as &quot;pure&quot; Q&amp;A as other StackExchange sites.

That is to say, an atheist is necessarily a person who lacks a belief in [God]. Some of us may favor a stricter definition, like one that eliminates all supernatural explanations and things like that. However, for the sake of having a workable definition that doesn't overly constrict atheism's usefulness as a word generally, it is preferred that we all mean: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An atheist is necessarily a person who lacks a belief in [God]. Atheism is the lack of a belief in [God].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use the [tag:semantics] tag to try to discuss the matter further in questions, but for the overall site, this is the common usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Closing, re-opening, editing ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to engage the community we should (vote to close if bad enough ), ask the questionner to make revisions (to subjective language), make some minor edits to steer them in the correct direction (comment about how edits can be rolled back if it looks like the user is new), and if the question remains unanswerable downvote and vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember, voting to close and closing (for users with enough rep) are tools to impose that the author edit his or her question. It should be construed as nothing more. Very good questions can be worded poorly, closed, [and the author can revise and get their question re-opened][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take pride in your question. Take ownership of it. If you have 5 people who vote to close it, that likely means there are five people who may not have understood what you meant. Clarify yourself in the text of the question. Closed question? **It's like an &quot;Under Construction&quot; sign**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this scenario mod tools are reserved, the community is working to ask better questions, reasons for editing are explicit, and expectations of questions are reinforced. Once you edit, rework, or otherwise improve your question put up a post on meta or in chat to ask for it to be re-opened. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[As for marking/flagging CW on answerable questions][2], this is typically reserved for when the question asks for multiple solutions to the same problem, lists of resources for atheism, and the community wants to assemble a variously edited/compiled question/answer to address something specific.

For instance, the entire history of medieval art is based in devotional works that are compelling to even the most secular of observers. High-relief carvings in naves of demons were meant as proselytizing mechanisms for illiterate peasants.

I have been a victim of quite a few downvotes just because the reader didn't agree with me, and I've seen this happening also to other people. I think this must be avoided. This is especially so in those cases where the OP is worded along the lines of &quot;what would you do...&quot;, i.e. is asking for your particular views or judgment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The current status quo must be accepted as a characteristic of the topic of atheism, in my opinion, and for the reasons that I sketched above.

Atheists also have many interests and reasons for looking for resources. Just as Christianity books have many, many sub-categories, so can atheism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, [in trying to keep in line with the suggestions over at the stackexchange blog, we are looking for a solution on managing our book questions][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **It is OK to edit a question to make it more general**. With the power of editing comes the power to take someone’s selfish, very specific question, and edit it a little bit until they’re asking the more general question that hundreds of people encounter. For example, if someone asks, “I set up a web server at home but I can’t access it from work,” it’s OK to rewrite the question as, “What things should I check when a web server running at home is not visible on the Internet?” In fact, sometimes selfish, stupid questions of the “do my homework” variety can be easily edited into a form where the answer will provide an extremely valuable resource for the internet at large.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Don’t answer questions that have already been answered elsewhere**. Yeah, you might earn a couple of points of reputation, but, because you are duplicating content, you are actually making the internet worse. Why? Because that answer might be true today, but as technology changes, it might not be true tomorrow. There are almost certainly thousands of wrong facts on Stack Overflow already, which may have been true when they were written but are no longer true. These facts will pollute the Internet for years. This problem is not tractable if we allow Stack Overflow to become just an endless river of questions and answers. It has to be more like a Wikipedia of Questions and Answers, with canonical answers that can be edited in one place, if we are ever going to stand a chance of keeping all the information that we expose to the Internet at least reasonably correct.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of special note is the concluding paragraph:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Help us build a great library of canonical answers**. If you keep seeing the same form of questions, whether it’s mod_rewrite rules on Server Fault, freezing computers on Super User, or how to use regular expressions to parse HTML, write a great, canonical answer, once and for all. Make it community wiki so that as many other people as possible can make it great. Work really hard on writing something that is clear, concise, and understandable by as wide an audience as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please list below your ideas for solutions on keeping the book suggestions from becoming too specific, repetitive, and toxic to the internet. Please note, in the majority of cases, any request for a list should be community wiki since it is basically unanswerable and completely open-ended. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a few caveats:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - When we have multiple questions on books, individual books/answers can be voted up as 'best'&#xD;&#xA; - When we have multiple questions, it is difficult to try to say this question should be closed when there's another one just like it in most respects out there with a bunch of answers&#xD;&#xA; - Managing lists of books should be useful. They should remain up to date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/" />

These questions need to meet two properties:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They need to be non-trivial and in large supply. If we are re-asking the same thing again and again, we are doomed.&#xD;&#xA; - They need to have known answers (i.e. someone in the community needs to know the answer), and the answer must be clear and more or less objective. If not, we will get into never ending arguments of opinions, and this is not a debate forum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if the topic were programming, somebody could ask &quot;how do I implement a bubble sort&quot;; there you have a question for which the poor guy does not have an answer, but clear, objective answers do exist, so that's a good question and everybody may have a go at answering it.

The end result is an uneven playing field, on which religious assertions are ignored or not even noticed... almost like water to a fish... while atheist comments are strongly resisted.  This is the background for the last 2000+ years.  It is why everyone, whether they practice it or not, has heard the maxim, &quot;Never discuss religion or politics in polite society.&quot;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We do not seek &quot;polite society&quot;... we seek an honest, true, just society... and if keeping silent allows various interests to preserve their unwarranted advantages, then discussion is required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is true that religious people, unaccustomed to having their assertions publicly questioned, will categorize this new stance among atheists as &quot;aggressive&quot; &quot;militant&quot; or &quot;evangelical.&quot; But in reality it is the far-too-delayed proper response to the religionists condescending &quot;tolerance&quot; of atheists, if we just be quiet and don't challenge their turf. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Public resistance to religion threatens membership in churches. It threatens political blocs and their almost guaranteed ability to rely on their flock for votes or action.  Resistance that steps on these types of toes will be fought &quot;aggressively&quot; by angry believers.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And if I dare steal from the circular logic of faith [(Matthew 5:10-12),][1] Atheists should take heart:  The fact that you are meeting resistance is proof that you are right and you must resist even more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.crossroad.to/Persecution/Scriptures.htm" />

These questions need to meet two properties:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - They need to be non-trivial and in large supply. If we are re-asking the same thing again and again, we are doomed.&#xD;&#xA; - They need to have known answers (i.e. someone in the community needs to know the answer), and the answer must be clear and more or less objective. If not, we will get into never ending arguments of opinions, and this is not a debate forum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, if the topic were programming, somebody could ask &quot;how do I implement a bubble sort&quot;; there you have a question for which the poor guy does not have an answer, but clear, objective answers do exist, so that's a good question and everybody may have a go at answering it. If the topic were biking, somebody could ask &quot;should I get an alumninium or carbon frame for my 12-year old daughter&quot;; same thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I don't think that atheism is a topic for which large numbers of questions for which clear answers exist can be generated. There are interesting issues to be discussed, sure, and the list that Evan posted at the top of this page is a good example. But *real* questions with *really clear answers*? I don't think so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have argued somewhere else that the reason why this is so is because atheism is not a field of knowledge. Computer programming or biking are. By &quot;field of knowledge&quot; I mean a discipline with a given ontology, epistemology, theory, method and methodology, where a body of knowledge can be more or less easily identifiable. Atheism is not like this; atheism is a position that one takes, but is not a field of knowledge. That's why it cannot generate large numbers of questions for which clear answers exist.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This leaves us here: either we admit that this kind of very subjective question, which is almost a discussion point rather than a proper question, is fine; or we abandon the idea of having a StackExchange site for atheism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anyone wants to prove me wrong, please provide 10 or 20 sample *real* questions about atheism that we haven't seen before.

However, while we might want to make an intellectual landgrab for our favorite context for atheism (in science, epistemology, semantics, etc), those contexts don't benefit our community in and of themselves (I could come up with selfish reasons for epistemology or semantics to be the added domain, but it would be for a reason that wouldn't add value to the site overall, just increase the population of questions). We need to annex a strain of thought that does the whole value-added thing by creating a context to ask questions in, that gives our questions and answers a practical focus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[On meta.stackoverflow I asked about whether other Area51 sites had re-scoped, as it were, before][4]. H[ere is Robert Cartaino's answer][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Many sites have expanded and contracted their scope after launch. Simply redefining what is meant by &quot;Atheism&quot; is within the purview of that community. There are no technical issues involved; simply coming to a consensus about policy, promotion, and enforcement of the issues with the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;But, if you are talking about wholesale changes to the definition of a site, I would first raise the issues in meta and build a strong consensus within the community. Chat rooms and schedule chat sessions can be a big help here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think a good way of considering how to annex some brainspace is to not think of the annex  as modifying our site by simple addition, ie `Atheism &amp; Blah`. Instead we should have some multiplicative addition; a way of taking our topical knowledge and making it more pointed, more practical, and ultimately more meaningful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. As a first step, vote up this question if you think a scope change is in order. Remember, this is not an idea meant to just add content with `&amp; Blah` to atheism, but is meant to add context to each and every question asked. It's meant to broaden the scope of what questions about Atheism mean in a practical sense.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Second, let's try to brainstorm some ways to make the Atheism site broader in it's impact, not just its libraries. Try to think of practical edges to add to atheism. **Post individual implementations as answers below.**&#xD;&#xA; 3. Third, we can have some scheduled chats, etc (as Robert recommends) as necessary, but we should try to build a consensus for how we would like to add focus to our site. Once we have a plan in place, we can contact the SE community support staff&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, this is not just to spur questions, but to allow flexibility and **encourage a focus in responding as well**. Specifically, we don't want to encumber ourselves by adding just some other discipline, but an actual, practical focus. Remember, [as it was mentioned][6], we don't want to add a discipline, and a bunch of its disciples, if all we add is a bunch of people responding to questions that they don't have good answers for, but have loud opinions about. This about adding focus and context, not principally about people and content (they come on their own for the quality).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/356/if-you-dont-believe-in-a-god-and-an-ultimate-meaning-why-get-up-in-the-morning&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/494/what-is-the-answer-to-the-ultimate-question-of-life-the-universe-and-everything&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2071/what-is-the-purpose-of-staying-alive-for-an-atheist&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/74545/what-models-for-expanding-the-scope-of-area-51-sites-during-public-beta-have-be/74580#74580&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/74545/what-models-for-expanding-the-scope-of-area-51-sites-during-public-beta-have-be/74580#74580&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/306525#306525" />

The Atheism Stack Exchange is supposed to be about building a canonical archive; a source for authoritative answers to decisive questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Polls are typically very basic *&quot;what do you think about&amp;hellip;&quot;* questions that have been asked hundreds of times on every other forum on the internet.  Asking interesting and challenging questions is hard. But when you compare that to asking questions  out of  mere curiosity (one that gives *everyone* the opportunity to sound off with random opinion), it becomes the low-hanging fruit of the system. More often than not, polls are a quick and dirty way to seed discussion without regard to the quality of the question or the answers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is not what we do here. It is the high quality questions and answers (and the high expectations) that separates these systems from the random phpBB noise and junk food found in most discussion forums.

An expectation that you can ask subjective questions about belief might be &quot;misguided&quot;, but it is &quot;understandable&quot; that we should want to try anyway, and an SE seems like a good way to go about it.

If you watch The Atheist Experience from Austin, it is in the process of that clarification that theist callers come up against their own logical fallacies. I have seen what I considered crazy atheist viewpoints too, such as Jesus being based on Horus or atheism being the point of view that humans are born with. There is a lot of mileage we could get out of that discussion once we handle all the philosophical arguments for god and what not. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think most atheist discussion forums are setup so a few angry people dominate and chase away the occasional theist who comes along wanting to try out their latest argument. So far, I think this format is keeping that under control pretty well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe the above from Gunn could be put in wiki form, with a little more clarification, and if a question is too broad, ask to clarify if they are talking about religion in terms of a specific belief, or as &quot;ultimate concerns&quot; in general, or as the social experience. With some refinement, it could help.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I have seen some discussion about atheism needing to be redefined, or people wanting to define themselves as something that isn't just an opposition to something, but that would be a different topic, a different SE. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the definition, because without all the religions and beliefs of the world to talk about, there is no topic. It is not like there is something that we all agree is god, and religions are either worshiping it correctly or missing the mark. Without religions, there is no god to not believe in. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We may have a tendency to see patterns, or put personalities on inanimate objects, or assume agency where there is none, or feel connected to the universe but that is psychology. An out of body experience can be induced and an epileptic seizure can give someone a sensation that they are experiencing the divine, but that is biology. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is absolutely fascinating to me that it is taking hundreds of years for us to work through understanding these phenomenon and understand how they have been used and abused throughout history.

However, while we might want to make an intellectual landgrab for our favorite context for atheism (in science, epistemology, semantics, etc), those contexts don't benefit our community in and of themselves (I could come up with selfish reasons for epistemology or semantics to be the added domain, but it would be for a reason that wouldn't add value to the site overall, just increase the population of questions). We need to annex a strain of thought that does the whole value-added thing by creating a context to ask questions in, that gives our questions and answers a practical focus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[On meta.stackoverflow I asked about whether other Area51 sites had re-scoped, as it were, before][5]. H[ere is Robert Cartaino's answer][6]:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Many sites have expanded and contracted their scope after launch. Simply redefining what is meant by &quot;Atheism&quot; is within the purview of that community. There are no technical issues involved; simply coming to a consensus about policy, promotion, and enforcement of the issues with the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;But, if you are talking about wholesale changes to the definition of a site, I would first raise the issues in meta and build a strong consensus within the community. Chat rooms and schedule chat sessions can be a big help here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think a good way of considering how to annex some brainspace is to not think of the annex  as modifying our site by simple addition, ie `Atheism &amp; Blah`. Instead we should have some multiplicative addition; a way of taking our topical knowledge and making it more pointed, more practical, and ultimately more meaningful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. As a first step, vote up this question if you think a scope change is in order. Remember, this is not an idea meant to just add content with `&amp; Blah` to atheism, but is meant to add context to each and every question asked. It's meant to broaden the scope of what questions about Atheism mean in a practical sense.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Second, let's try to brainstorm some ways to make the Atheism site broader in it's impact, not just its libraries. Try to think of practical edges to add to atheism. **Post individual implementations as answers below.**&#xD;&#xA; 3. Try to POST 1 ON-TOPIC, &amp; 2 OFF-TOPIC EXAMPLE QUESTIONS a la Area51s process&#xD;&#xA; 4. Third, we can have some scheduled chats, etc (as Robert recommends) as necessary, but we should try to build a consensus for how we would like to add focus to our site. Once we have a plan in place, we can contact the SE community support staff&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, this is not just to spur questions, but to allow flexibility and **encourage a focus in responding as well**. Specifically, we don't want to encumber ourselves by adding just some other discipline, but an actual, practical focus. Remember, [as it was mentioned][7], we don't want to add a discipline, and a bunch of its disciples, if all we add is a bunch of people responding to questions that they don't have good answers for, but have loud opinions about. This about adding focus and context, not principally about people and content (they come on their own for the quality).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/356/if-you-dont-believe-in-a-god-and-an-ultimate-meaning-why-get-up-in-the-morning&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/494/what-is-the-answer-to-the-ultimate-question-of-life-the-universe-and-everything&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2071/what-is-the-purpose-of-staying-alive-for-an-atheist&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/268/on-broadening-the-scope-of-our-site-what-should-atheism-merge-with&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/74545/what-models-for-expanding-the-scope-of-area-51-sites-during-public-beta-have-be/74580#74580&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/74545/what-models-for-expanding-the-scope-of-area-51-sites-during-public-beta-have-be/74580#74580&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/306525#306525" />

This is a great feature, but it entails some risks. Imagine that Alice posts a question and a few people write answers. Later, Bob comes along and edits Alice's question. If Bob's edits are small (i.e. fixing typos, rewording a sentence to make it better), then that's great. But if Bob's edits are *so extensive as to significantly alter the meaning of Alice's original question*, then the existing answers are probably rendered inadequate. Maybe Bob believes that he is doing everyone a favour by clarifying Alice's words, but how can he know what's in other people's minds regarding the interpretation of the question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Case in point (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2477/has-evolutionary-psychology-explained-the-origin-of-religion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;): recently, I wrote an answer to a question titled:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Is there a genetic basis for belief in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a higher power (or, conversely, is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there a genetic basis for atheism)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My answer focused on what I think to be a tenuous link between genetics and religion, as explained by Dawkins in &quot;The God Delusion&quot;. After I wrote my answer and left the site, another user (not the original poster), edited the question to something very different:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Has evolutionary psychology explained&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the origin of religion?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My answer was left there, totally inadequate. To make things worse, the user who edited the question also downvoted my answer, arguing that it didn't address *evolutionary psychology*, when, in reality, the original question didn't ask for that (but for *genetic basis*); the &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot; bit was added by this user through his edit after the fact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A long discussion followed with no satisfactory resolution. In my opinion, this practice of heavy editing where the semantics of a question are significantly altered *after* some answers exist is not respectful to the community, and not elegant or polite. Therefore, I suggest that we think carefully before we perform lareg edits on a question with answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think?

It is not only for atheists, but also for anyone else who lives with an atheist, knows an atheist, is scared of atheists, or just wants to understand what is going through the atheistic mind. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We are looking for good questions. This community is all about bringing the experts to the questions and if the questions aren't good enough to draw experts nothing will. Questions need to be focused on a problem or situation that you actually want solved; they are not some pre-tense for a rhetorical moment in the sun for anyone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have a question about:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - How to carry on an intelligent conversation as or with an atheist&#xD;&#xA; - How to understand some concept an atheist is talking about&#xD;&#xA; - The underlying logic behind many timeless arguments and debates&#xD;&#xA; - Support as or for an atheist who is dealing with cultural displacement&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...the hit the `Ask Question` link and let's fire it up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What about other atheism-related questions? Atheism bumps up against many other disciplines from science to philosophy and has rough edges with theism. That doesn't mean those things are out of bounds, but remember: you're asking about atheism, most likely you're asking an atheist of some stripe, and this isn't a soap box.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please note that the following subjects are considered off-topic here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Book/Movie/Documentary/Blog swapping (&quot;I need a magic book to prove me right!&quot;)&#xD;&#xA; - General information about religion&#xD;&#xA; - General information about science&#xD;&#xA; - General questions pertaining only to philosophy&#xD;&#xA; - How to humiliate some guy in a coffee shop&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say you can't talk about it in the chat channel, but we are not interested in it here and we cannot tolerate it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;##What is Atheism##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may not realize how important a good definition is or how hard it is to come by until a few days talking incessantly about it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the purposes of discussion, and this is a debated point up for revision, the community generally uses atheism in a more inclusive sense. That is to say, an atheist is necessarily a person who lacks a belief in [God]. Some of us may favor a stricter definition, like one that eliminates all supernatural explanations and things like that. However, for the sake of having a workable definition that doesn't overly constrict atheism's usefulness as a word generally, it is preferred that we all mean: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An atheist is necessarily a person who lacks a belief in [God]. Atheism is the lack of a belief in [God].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can use the [tag:semantics] tag to try to discuss the matter further in questions, but for the overall site, this is the common usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Closing, re-opening, editing ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order to engage the community we should (vote to close if bad enough ), ask the questionner to make revisions (to subjective language), make some minor edits to steer them in the correct direction (comment about how edits can be rolled back if it looks like the user is new), and if the question remains unanswerable downvote and vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Remember, voting to close and closing (for users with enough rep) are tools to impose that the author edit his or her question. It should be construed as nothing more. Very good questions can be worded poorly, closed, [and the author can revise and get their question re-opened][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take pride in your question. Take ownership of it. If you have 5 people who vote to close it, that likely means there are five people who may not have understood what you meant. Clarify yourself in the text of the question. Closed question? **It's like an &quot;Under Construction&quot; sign**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this scenario mod tools are reserved, the community is working to ask better questions, reasons for editing are explicit, and expectations of questions are reinforced. Once you edit, rework, or otherwise improve your question put up a post on meta or in chat to ask for it to be re-opened. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[As for marking/flagging CW on answerable questions][2], this is typically reserved for when the question asks for multiple solutions to the same problem, lists of resources for atheism, and the community wants to assemble a variously edited/compiled question/answer to address something specific.

Their mythology aside, I believe that if you took four negotiators, two atheist Israeli and Palestinians, and two believer Israeli and Palestinians and sat them down across from their counterparts, you'd see more progress and faster progress (on average) from the secular pair than the religious pair.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To indulge their mythology, or the US mythology, or any other for that matter is to give way to irrationality over rationality.  There's no need to indulge their irrationality when simply staying to the facts to be negotiated can produce outcomes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is exactly how I negotiate with christian owned businesses as a contractor.  I do not indulge their nuttiness, I simply allow for it and continue basic, simple negotiations.

Primarily, it would seem, the key role played by religion is in controlling the believers world view, and by extension the believers view of others. The ability to effect such impact on global affairs is not insignificant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that the atheist has rejected the theist's belief, i.e. there is no defensible truth to the claim, the question then becomes who propagates the lie and why? Clearly there exists a benefit in propagating the lie and that benefit may be measured as power; be it economic (tithe), coercive (warfare, personal or national) or cultural. All of these combine to secure the ongoing relevance of the very beast itself, it is a self reinforcing system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These things do all of course occur in the secular world as well, however in the secular world they are subject to the scrutiny of the people. Religion, being self referent is not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The question is who benefits from religion and how?&#xD;&#xA;" />

The scope of the site is too narrow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About the first one, what needs to be said is that atheism is a topic many people are misled into thinking they are knowledgeable. The unfortunate truth is that philosophy - which is what most questions are about - is a lot harder than they realize. Whole books are written about the philosophy of religion. It's not a topic a layman can claim to master without first doing a lot of reading. Otherwise, he'll inevitably use many arguments that have been demolished decades ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to the second point, it's quite clear that &quot;atheism&quot; is too limited of a subject. There are so many interesting questions that go beyond that scope. that's why it has been suggested to [merge with religion or philosophy][3].

It is not at all unlike the argument between Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, not that atheists as a minority can be compared equally to their struggle, but I assume people are familiar with it so I use it as an analogy.

It seems part of the problem is trying to make it fit the stack exchange standard. It seems to me adjustments could be made.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with this site is its scope. The scope is too narrow. We have banned part (religion) of the topic (atheism), which is integral to discussion, as off-topic. Focusing on the topic is less on task than focusing on the endeavor of the inquiry. There is an unacknowledged subtext to all questions about atheism that does not exist with cooking or superuser'ing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a minimalist/reductionist definition of atheism being used to define the scope for questions, and it is killing the content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not posting to promote my prop on Area 51, however I think that there is an umbrella topic of [Comparative Studies][1] (encapsulating Philosophy, Religion, Atheism) that would better allow standards and content for questions to more distinctly emerge. Atheism on its own is too truncated a view of the topic. Semantics aside, I do not believe atheism is a negative position for many people who subscribe to it insofar as it constitutes a building block of their identity. However, to talk about it without discussing what it is defined in contradistinction to (or to assume that any question involving religion is likely off-topic) is far narrower a view than any real inquiry of any topic would allow. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[My proposal seeks to unify this realm of inquiry (Philosophy, Religion, Atheism) under one heterogeneous community][2]. In my view, the other two (and most species of religion generally, but not 'Biblical Hermeneutics') will fall into the same gambit where there are 1 or 2 other topics that are integral to the discussion, but off-topic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For atheism at least, only through the merger of all three of these topics can we set a context for exploring what is both (a) a very scholarly, expert-populated field of study, and (b) a difficult-to-contain-as-&quot;good subjective.&quot; What is missing (why this seems un-constructive) is a context, a setting for the Q/As over-arching discussion. By excising Religion from the site and fixating too doggedly on just atheism, perception of the historicity and lineage of this study has languished.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am always comfortable having my questions criticized. However, there is a default &quot;there is no atheist answer&quot; reply that many people use. For people who believe that the community of atheism is faceless, I feel they are missing an entire component of the inquiry. To not accept that atheism is a choice and creates friction in one's sense of identity is absurd. To close questions because they deal with trying to reconcile theist issues with an atheist perspective seems, on its face, like not facing issues or telling people to shut up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem is less to do with applying atheism to the stack exchange model as it is to not allowing questions to borrow from related topics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/29214/comparative-thinking-belief-knowledge-systems?referrer=nKAzd1fMMiMOKYl-gzfdoQ2&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/q/634/5985" />

One problem I find is that many questions aren't presented clearly enough, and so lots of responses are generated to tangential topics, either as answers or comments.

Three potential issues with this solution are, (1) changing people's habits, (2) questions spawned from other questions are quite likely to be seen as too similar, and closed as such, and (3) sometimes a back-and-forth debate is the only option for addressing a particular point of contention. I think the first two issues could be address by having clear guidelines in the FAQ, and active moderators who agree on what those guidelines entail. I don't think the third can be addressed without allowing a discussion/debate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;  So alternatively we could loosen the restriction and allow discussions and debates, while encouraging adherence to the Q&amp;A format.

Also, as those stacks have yet to develop, I think it would not be out of place to exercise and share the philosophical and religious knowledge that atheists do acquire. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of science, if it is about theoretical physics, guess what, there's a stack for that. Point them there. Same thing with biology. If it is about evolutionary psychology, that's a bit of a gray area. Not because there aren't better experts on the subject, but because atheists would be enriched sharing that knowledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am approaching scope from the type of content, rather than the subject of the content. Basically, I propose two qualifications for broadening the scope:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;the content presents...&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Value added: the question is pertinent to a current discussion in atheism, and although it may be tangential to the discussion, the knowledge is generally applicable to atheist knowledge. I.E. The discussion on [evolutionary psychology][1] (in the question &quot;[Is theism a predisposition][2]?&quot;) contributes a theoretical response to the common question asked of atheists, &quot;If there is no God, where does morality come from?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Heterogeneity in atheism: many of our questions seem to be seeking some definitive answer. However, this kind of expectation of a community as diverse as each individuals deconversion story is unrealistic. We are going to have a stack that is more discussion-y than English Grammar and Usage. That doesn't mean questions cannot demand methodical answers; that doesn't mean answers don't need to show their (critical thinking) work. We should allow a question and answer to dwell more in the '[good subjective][3]' than in the objective; and we should be more strict regarding any dwelling in the '[bad subjective][4].'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two concerns I have opening the gate to these two allowances have nothing to do with lowering our standards on the questions/answers (if anything, we need to be twice as rigorous). My concerns are these:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Incessant nitpicking: My first concern is that we will feed the bug that insists on creating these mammoth threads in the comments of an answer. I personally find myself distracted by these at the minimum, annoyed and aggravated on bad days. Imagine we had some notable like Hitchens stumble on the site and post an answer, do you think he would stick around if we quibble over every nitpick? Yeah, so cut it out with everyone else. This isn't cooking where bad advice is might end in a case of botulism. You know what works for that kind of discussion? CHAT. Thats what it's for. Go *there*. (...and if you have some 12 comment thread, and the person makes the edit you *needed them to make*, then delete your comments.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Inevitability of &quot;Inconsistent Enforcement&quot; QQ: Yeah. We will be inconsistent at first: it will get better and standards will be more formalized. But remember, (a) closing is not permanent, (b) all questions can be re-opened, or asked better. Even the best question or answer can still be better with a collaborative effort. The issue bigger than over-closing, is over-answering. Answering bad questions frequently  makes editing questions to be answerable almost impossible. We can occasionally harness the motives of one subjective, vote-to-close-bait question and edit it into an objectively answerable question. Answers on bad questions make editors feel sad. Editors honestly don't want to orphan your answer; also, editors don't want to deal with QQ'ing about how your answer was so great for the original question. If you answered a bad question, and it was edited into shape, you'll want to adjust your answer to fit. &#xD;&#xA;  - I'm less worried about backlash than people being discouraged and *not trying to work to forge the framework*.

Expertise requires knowledge, not belief, and atheism and theism are not knowledge based subjects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the areas of knowledge that Lausten mentions, you could argue that atheists should also have some knowledge of Theology in order to counter the so-called Courtier's Reply. You may also want to add (as mentioned on another thread) Geology and Cosmology. However, these scientific areas of knowledge would be used to rebut specific claims about reality that the religious get from their holy books or ideology, which isn't really about atheism/theism.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I disagree with the claims of belligerence and activism; being passive hasn't exactly worked for atheists up to now, has it? And how is this different from the belligerence of the religious exhorting us to convert lest we go to Hell and burn for eternity? Or holding 'God hates fags' signs? Is it just that we're used to seeing this from the religious, and pass it off as just expected religious fervour, but we're not used to seeing it from the non-religious/godless? What's the real difference between 'You're a sinner for not believing.' and 'You're an idiot for believing.'?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't see a theist troll, but I do see an accomodationist who says we should be respectful and polite toward those who believe (turn the other cheek?), even in the face of their vitriol.

Where do you suppose we imported them from? Morality (by all the manifold names it known) is inherent in a social species in order for populations to survive. I venture that it is religion that has imported morality and twisted it into something else to suit its agenda. You're right in saying that a discussion of morality might take place in a philosophy forum. But then what about Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape? Is there no input from science into questions of morality?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps instead of simply trashing what it is at the moment, you could offer some constructive thoughts on what it should/could become.

There are bound to be loose interpretations, or connotation based uses. For Anti-theism to be properly on-topic it needs to meet two standards: academic rigor first, social appropriateness second. Content that does not meet the following criteria should be flagged, and questions should be closed as &quot;Argumentative &amp; Subjective&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of Academic rigor, the usage must meet the following criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Anti-theism is not personally antagonistic of theists necessarily; as a position it is at most *adversarial*. Consequently, usage of Anti-theist argumentation directed toward theisTS is off topic and should be flagged. Disguising rancorous or condescending talk as thoughtful or well-researched shows a lack of respect for the community.**&#xD;&#xA; - Anti-theism is not a sentiment, it is not a feeling. Proper usage contains the specific &quot;doctrine antagonistic to theism; 'denial' of the existence of a God; opposition to God&quot;; further, &quot;To be clear, 'opposition to God' is not in most meanings a statement that an anti-theist believes in a deity but opposes the being, but for various reasons the position that it would be bad/immoral for such a being to exist.([wiki][2])&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Anti-theism as a concept is used as an indicator of antipathy for belief in theism.  &quot;The concept allows a distinction to be drawn between the simple indifference or apathy towards theism, atheism, or agnosticism (cf. apatheism)... Antitheism has been adopted as a label by those who take the view that theism is dangerous or destructive.([wiki][3])&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Anti-theism, in a literal usage, can be used in a fashion to ask about activism as an atheist (strong atheism is a part of anti-theism, and anti-theism ties into secularism very frequently). When considering whether Anti-theism is being appropriately used in this fashion, ramp up the standards for the question itself: &#xD;&#xA;  1. Did the question-asker make it very clear what the problem is? &#xD;&#xA;  2. Did the question-asker make it very clear how to provide good answers? &#xD;&#xA;  3. Does the question give a tangible context for the question, or are they asking a general question that applies in all manner of situation?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of social appropriateness:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Personal attacks are not accepted on any other stack, this is no exception. Honestly, a situation where someone divulges personal information about themselves in good faith makes it *even less acceptable*.**&#xD;&#xA; - We are trying to engage, recruit and maintain a corps of &quot;experts&quot; on atheism; or at the minimum, thoughtful people who are able to answer a wide variety of questions and have knowledge and sources to back up their answers. Ensure your answer is trying to provide an answer in a novel or well-polished fashion.&#xD;&#xA; - We are not trying to display our skills at ranting. If you answered the question, and used 4-6 paragraphs without a citation try to go back and break it down. Add a few sources, use a list to condense the salient points. (Hint: the 4-6 paragraphs also leads to TL;DR syndrome)&#xD;&#xA; - Avoid adding anti-theist flair. Some humor is acceptable, but condescension (especially toward the question-asker) is absolutely unallowable. I don't want to read it before answering, OP's don't want to be chastised, and it makes this a worse place to be. Posts that have extraneous commentary of this ilk should be flagged edited to excise the problem areas (with a comment to inform and explain why). If the answer no longer works, this is a matter for the original respondent to address.&#xD;&#xA; - (Explanations / Reliance on) Anti-theism will be structural to a very limited set of special cases (i.e. activism related questions). Just as igtheism, apatheism, and specifically strong or weak atheism have limited uses, so does anti-theism.  &#xD;&#xA; - As Anti-theism is specific in that it categorizes a school of thought; *it does not make conclusions about a group of people*. To assume as much is to cast a net over a very large generalization. Use should not be directed at any particular group of people, only the belief itself.&#xD;&#xA; - Some questions will arise that are inherently 'Getting-to-know-you' (GTKY), and in the vast majority of cases these should be eliminated. But putting anti-theist behavior on a pedestal doesn't shine to well on said posts survival.

God created us as part of a bigger plan; we are all infused with God's spirit; there is an absolute right and wrong; I am going to heaven; etc etc. As someone stated, a person with these beliefs is trading in their intellectual honesty in exchange for comfort and a perceived purpose to their lives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Atheism is supposedly a break from that self-deception. We value intellectual honesty above a false sense of purpose. But is that really true?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As one example - to many people, one of the most offensive things that a theist can say to an atheist is that you can only be moral if you believe in God. As atheists, we are quick to reject that notion and prove that morality really comes from social norms and religion has merely adopted the same values (mostly), not dictated them. But there's always that implied and unquestioned agreement that we should be moral.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me, if you want to be intellectually honest all the way down, you have to recognize that there is really and truly no higher purpose to anything, which means there is no such thing as &quot;should&quot;. We are here as flukes of evolution, we will live out our lives, and we will be gone. Whether people are kind or unkind to each other has only fleeting and small-scale significance, at best. More realistically, it has no significance whatsoever. In fact, the existence of the entire human race might be over in nothing but a brief moment of evolutionary time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So it seems that even atheists are still stuck in the pattern of trying to find significance and purpose where there is none. Bleak as it may be, the reality is that there is no purpose. If we choose to pretend that there is so that we can live &quot;productive&quot; lives, we should at least recognize that we're doing it for those reasons. Assuming of course that we really do value intellectual honesty. To me though, it just feels like the Matrix, where a few people are intentionally allowed to &quot;escape&quot; in order to foster the belief that they have beaten the system and thereby keep the system going (ignoring, of course, that the last Neo was a true singularity and really destroyed the Matrix, which I thought ruined the story). We have shed one layer of intellectual dishonesty - that our purpose comes from God - but still cling to a lower layer - that we still have a purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But why does anything matter? Why should someone who understands that there is no higher purpose waste time and energy adhering to social norms, trying to be &quot;good&quot;, etc? The normal response to that is - by being a good citizen and friend, you create an environment that is better for yourself. By why does that matter? Why should I be happier with lots of friends and money than I would be as a lonely bum in an alley? Or rather, why should I care that I would be happier. And yes, society would fall apart if everyone thought this way, but you already know my answer - so what?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The honest answer is that it doesn't matter. I would experience some &quot;discomfort&quot; as a bum in an alley, but even that is not a &quot;bad&quot; thing. It's just my brain trying to induce me to avoid a situation that reduces my chances of spreading my genes, because that's what it has evolved to do. But the only reason I try to spread my genes is that I have evolved to try to spread my genes, nothing more. And yet, none of us stop trying to live &quot;better&quot; lives. The social and genetic programming in us is much too strong for that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Back to the title question - are we really being honest to ourselves? Or does being atheistic help give us a false sense of being &quot;intellectually honest&quot; and allow us to avoid the question just as effectively as theists do? And is this especially true for those of us who were formerly religious and now congratulate ourselves on having broken free?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(And I fully recognize the double hypocrisy inherent in even asking this question, and in doing it anonymously. If I truly believed that it didn't matter, I wouldn't have bothered, right? So yes, I am as guilty as anyone in finding it hard to let go of my own self-importance.)" />

If so, then the questions of secularism and a pluralistic society may be worth considering as a possible expansion to the scope of the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a constructive suggestion, I would like to propose 3 topics that be considered relevant to being a self-declared atheist, and hence on-topic for this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Personal Meaning and the Origins of Humanity**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simply declaring a non-belief in a higher power doesn't render us immune to the innate human inclination to search for meaning and purpose in life. There are centuries of thought (both secular and religious) that we can draw from in order to decide for ourselves what it is that prompts us to get out of bed each day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also plenty of questions to be asked and answered regarding the scientific alternatives to religious creation stories regarding the origins of humanity, life, Earth and the Universe in general.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ethics and Morality**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many modern legal systems are based nominally on particular religious traditions. However, most aspects of the human sense of right and wrong transcend particular belief systems and recur again and again throughout the world. Starting from basic principles of freedom, compassion, honesty and justice, there are many helpful answers to be drawn from philosophy, economics and other disciplines regarding how humans relate to each other and the world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Secularism, Tolerance and Pluralism**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a particularly significant subset of ethics and morality in the modern world, the separation of Church and State is a powerful force for justice, as it requires that legal systems and government institutions be founded in basic ethical principles rather than arbitrary dictates of a controlling priesthood. However, tolerating differences in personal belief, while enforcing respect for the freedoms for others can require a delicate balancing act, both for the State and for individuals. Dealing graciously with a variety of belief systems, without allowing those belief systems to exert undue influence over science or the legal system is a challenging but necessary activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Good Questions**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Asking for suggestions regarding organisations, books, websites or other publications that can help with understanding any or all of the above topics is always a reasonable question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With so many questions related to these topics being highly personal and otherwise arguable based on starting assumptions, Atheism.SE is slightly more tolerant than most SE sites to subjective questions with no right answer. Be respectful, stay on topic and this should be fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bad Questions**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your question includes thinly veiled (or even blatant) assumptions that all beliefs in a higher power are inherently stupid (as opposed to factually incorrect, but perfectly understandable in a social context) then it's a bad question. A meme as pervasive as belief in a higher power doesn't get that way without at least a few points in its favour (even if &quot;in accordance with observable reality&quot; isn't one of them).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your question is just an excuse to rant, it's a bad question. If you want to rant at the world, get a blog, don't do it here." />

IMO freethinking is a kind of critical or sceptical thinking with a special object: beliefs (or even better but more prone to misinterpretation: ideologies (including religions)).&#xD;&#xA;The reason &quot;atheïsm&quot; raises a lot of problems: In itself A is a conclusion. It is the conclusion you reach when you think critically about religions. Drawing this conclusion leaves you with little handles for other questions, e.g. about morality.&#xD;&#xA;But even if one would make the exchange for freethinking or skepticism, I think the Q&amp;A approach is not adequate for these kind of things as has been stated else." />

As it stands, the question is very open-ended. On the other hand, a definition could be requested that would fit a specific descriptive role. (I.E. Through historical, sociological, psychological, etc elements of religion - religion is very well defined; there are books written just defining it and the problems with defining it. However, even among the religious there is no consensus on the appropriate approach of defining it.)" />

These [tag:Churches-Gone-Wild] questions should help us refine and critique our own methods for perceiving how history has unfolded. As we do so we can contribute further and more richly to  Surely in some cases, a church may surprisingly have been complicit; on the other hand, there is no doubt that some have fought good and hard against certain atrocities. Some answers may encapsulate a single church speaking and doing very different things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of atheists focusing on these questions is to better understand the tertiary issues faced by atheists. When Hitchens claims &quot;God is not great&quot;, he builds an entirely consequentialist argument, asserts its completeness; this question tag is meant to fully examine the impact of religion upon history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**However**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is going to be (hopefully) a community wiki for all of your IMO's, that (hopefully) will serve as a living repository for method. The [tag:Churches-Gone-Wild] tag is not the place for IMO. It is for hard, analytic questions asking for objective connections between action A and consequence B. Beware the *post hoc ergo prompter hoc*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, the question asking generally about &quot;[How could we calculate the impact of religion?][2]&quot; is already about *how* to perceive the impact, *how* to connect the ley lines from historical events to the religions' actions of the time. This is a question *about* history and religion, and although a question of consequence to atheists, it is not a question about atheism in particular or its methods. To be critically and constructively about atheism and its methods, and suitable for [tag:churches-gone-wild], new questions must do the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Focus on a specific event (possibly a short time period), and how to draw consequences from it &#xD;&#xA; - Consequences should *[support an anti-theist perspective][4]* adversarial to a theist position that would otherwise expunge or ignore the impact of a religion on the event. (*Or explain why anti-theism is not necessary.*)&#xD;&#xA; - i.e. &quot;What role did the Catholic Church have in the Holocaust? Was it complicit in mass genocide?&quot; &#xD;&#xA;   - (Note: This question allows for both sides to answer and give objective responses. It is *incredibly* argumentative and objectionable and flamebait, and possibly not permissable; but if good answers can follow from more refined versions of the question, i.e. asking about Hitler's Bishop specifically, it might actually *draw more people*)`*`&#xD;&#xA; - Not a Good Example: What did Hinduism have to do with the practice of [Sati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice))?&#xD;&#xA;   - Too general, no specific consequence or leading action, too much room for &quot;IMO&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Better: What aspects of Hindu life contributed to Widows committing Sati?&#xD;&#xA;   - Questions rising circumstances endemic to Hindu life, but must be restricted to the *religious* aspects in order to remain on-topic. There are limited, specific aspects of a widow's life that were *religiously sanctioned* that would lead me to commit Sati. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is why the &quot;Was Hitler a Catholic?&quot; question (or however that was posed) was on-topic. Like any mass-identity group, churches seek to affiliate themselves with their best, and disassociate themselves with their worst. These questions are for [tag:churches-gone-wild].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Caveat: I am having a difficulty composing a suitable, spelled out, example question that doesn't sound heinous. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; My primary concern with a [tag:churches-gone-wild] question, is that if we end up with a massive amount of them, they could devolve into horrible, horrible scapegoatings, stone-thorowings, and peeing in soup. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The only way of putting that in check is to use examples where there is some explicit denial on the part of a possibly culpable religion. Again, an example that comes to mind are abortion clinic bombings? I don't know, obviously this is not good or prime for front page yet, but refinements can be made once we start.

Was it complicit in mass genocide?&quot; (Note: This question allows for both sides to answer and give objective responses. It is *incredibly* argumentative and objectionable, and possibly not permissable, but if good answers can follow from more refined versions, it might actually *draw more people*)`*`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is why the &quot;Was Hitler a Catholic?&quot; question (or however that was posed) was on-topic. Churches seek to affiliate themselves with their best, and disassociate themselves with their worst. Setting a specific purpose to the question would turn it around; it would give meaning for anyone interested. It could be filed under [tag:debate-points] or we could come up with a new one like [tag:churches-gone-wild].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, this might light up the switchboards on new questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, does this answer the question currently posed? No. However, I don't think the question is answerable. Follow-up: Should it be community wiki? Maybe, and that would change some things. If we repurpose the question, it can serve as a living repository for how different atheists think through these matters. (BTW: I am not one to actively suggest we should *create* a CW, I generally hold out hope the question can be refined. This might be the best exemption of that rule ever though.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I am having a difficulty composing a suitable, spelled out, example question that doesn't sound heinous. My fear with a [tag:churches-gone-wild] question, is that if we end up with a massive amount of them, they will devolve into horrible, horrible scapegoatings, stone-thorowings. The only way of putting that in check is to use examples where there is some explicit denial on the part of a possibly culpable religion. Perhaps abortion clinic bombings? I don't know, obviously this is not good or prime for front page yet, but refinements can be made. Obviously this isn't all about traffic or feeding each others' egos (I, for one, do not want to participate in hateful games); but debunking denialism of the darker corners of the churches seems like a fair motive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[tag:TL-DR]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/143/111&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/36/111&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/36/philosophical-discussions-about-skepticism/39#39&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/349/is-anti-theism-a-valid-topic-for-this-stack-exchange/357#357" />
