(possible flame-bait)</p>\n\n<p>Are there any standard, or well known, belief system issues, which Atheists do not, as a whole, agree on?

I don't think anything productive can come from such a question. Perhaps if it were reformulated as: do atheists think they know the answer to everything?

That is to say, an atheist is necessarily a person who lacks a belief in [God]. Some of us may favor a stricter definition, like one that eliminates all supernatural explanations and things like that. However, for the sake of having a workable definition that doesn't overly constrict atheism's usefulness as a word generally, it is preferred that we all mean: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An atheist is necessarily a person who lacks a belief in [God]. Atheism is the lack of a belief in [God].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/semantics\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'semantics'\" rel=\"tag\">semantics</a> tag to try to discuss the matter further in questions, but for the overall site, this is the common usage.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Closing, re-opening, editing</h2>\n\n<p>In order to engage the community we should (vote to close if bad enough ), ask the questionner to make revisions (to subjective language), make some minor edits to steer them in the correct direction (comment about how edits can be rolled back if it looks like the user is new), and if the question remains unanswerable downvote and vote to close.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, voting to close and closing (for users with enough rep) are tools to impose that the author edit his or her question. It should be construed as nothing more. Very good questions can be worded poorly, closed, <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/36415/how-do-you-reopen-a-closed-question\">and the author can revise and get their question re-opened</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Take pride in your question. Take ownership of it. If you have 5 people who vote to close it, that likely means there are five people who may not have understood what you meant. Clarify yourself in the text of the question. Closed question? <strong>It's like an \"Under Construction\" sign</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In this scenario mod tools are reserved, the community is working to ask better questions, reasons for editing are explicit, and expectations of questions are reinforced.

Atheists and theists are better served by art works that can motivate them to a better understanding of the others' perspective and keeps them from talking past each other.</p>\n\n<p>What kind of a dialog, or it's phrasing, successfully engages both atheists and theists in works of art? Are there specific themes, or perhaps ways of pulling together a work that will make it one that challenges atheists and theists in such a way that there is communication between the two? How do successful art works differ from the works that break off conversation and cauterize both camps?</p>\n\n<p>An interesting example of an attempt at dialog between the two camps was when the displays of Damien Hirst (atheist painter/sculpter) and Bill Viola (works about martyrs and saints) were put up in St. Paul's Cathedral. It was a dialog opportunity for everyone willing to be silent for a few minutes while they absorbed the work. Many of the religions and other social groups solidify and expand their influence by engaging in cross-belief dialog; what do successful works have that challenge both groups to understand the other, rather than simply repulse ?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>some comments: \n - I seek agreeable areas of art (the shared language) that can engage atheists and theists alike, and challenge them to understand the other, rather than simply repulse. For instance, the entire history of medieval art is based in devotional works that are compelling to even the most secular of observers. High-relief carvings in naves of demons were meant as proselytizing mechanisms for illiterate peasants. This is a tactic that today is interesting and food for discussion to both camps for its over-the-top nature.

This problem is not tractable if we allow Stack Overflow to become just an endless river of questions and answers.

Remember, this is not an idea meant to just add content with <code>&amp; Blah</code> to atheism, but is meant to add context to each and every question asked. It's meant to broaden the scope of what questions about Atheism mean in a practical sense.</li>\n<li>Second, let's try to brainstorm some ways to make the Atheism site broader in it's impact, not just its libraries.

(e.g., the underlying truth of the existence of God, the dharma, etc.); second, religion as it is psychologically experienced by people (e.g., the feelings of\nthe religious believer about divinity or ultimate concerns, the holy, etc.); and\nthird, religion as a cultural or social force (e.g., symbolism that binds a\ncommunity together or separates it from other communities).</p>\n\n<p>I went searching for the source and found a document by Jeremy Gunn with an introduction titled \"The Understandable, But Misguided, Quest for a Legal Definition of \u201cReligion\u201d. An expectation that you can ask subjective questions about belief might be \"misguided\", but it is \"understandable\" that we should want to try anyway, and an SE seems like a good way to go about it.

If you watch The Atheist Experience from Austin, it is in the process of that clarification that theist callers come up against their own logical fallacies. I have seen what I considered crazy atheist viewpoints too, such as Jesus being based on Horus or atheism being the point of view that humans are born with. There is a lot of mileage we could get out of that discussion once we handle all the philosophical arguments for god and what not. </p>\n\n<p>I think most atheist discussion forums are setup so a few angry people dominate and chase away the occasional theist who comes along wanting to try out their latest argument. So far, I think this format is keeping that under control pretty well. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe the above from Gunn could be put in wiki form, with a little more clarification, and if a question is too broad, ask to clarify if they are talking about religion in terms of a specific belief, or as \"ultimate concerns\" in general, or as the social experience.

New Atheism, the movement,  has changed the tenor of atheists to define themselves oppositionally to theists, their mortal enemy and their persecutors, to whom they must be ever vigilant against.  Right now, I have 2 views on one of my questions, with 1 vote to close, and no comment -- most likely because to some in this community my unorthodox views smell like those of a \"theist troll.\"  Although it should be pretty clear I'm quite disdainful of atheist activism, I'm not the only one to notice this aggressiveness, and a few voices on meta seem to have already piped up against this increasingly fractious trend.</p>\n\n<p>The second reason is structural, in that atheism, as a negative philosophy or position, cannot have experts.   The difference between here, and a productive StackExchange, like Math.SE, where I'm most active, could not be more clear: There, a good user can turn a sow's ear into a silk purse; bad questions can still have remarkable threads because mathematics is explicitly constructive in a extremely well defined way.  Here, a bad question just stays a bad question, or worse, becomes flame-bait, because atheism as philosophy is NOT constructive, it's completely agnostic as to moral precepts and values.   One might import various moral theories into an atheistic worldview, but then we'd be talking about a Philosophy Stack Exchange, wouldn't we? The discussion level there would be higher, but even there keeping up with constructive questions would require staying abreast of the field in the most esoteric journals, it would be quite difficult... </p>\n\n<p>The best Stack Exchanges, to me, seem to have this quality where responses can be constructive despite bad questions, or limited knowledge:  \"Hm, A.\" \"I can't answer that, but can answer A/2, which is quite similar...\" or \"Wow, that is a really bad question B.  In fact, B offers a pedagogical exercise in what not to do in related situations C, D &amp; E...\" \"Really bad B actually occurs as the result of an obscure history....\"  Etc.  They invite specific and targeted questions, and experts to give good answers, because of their explicit constructiveness.

The scope is too narrow. We have banned part (religion) of the topic (atheism), which is integral to discussion, as off-topic. Focusing on the topic is less on task than focusing on the endeavor of the inquiry. There is an unacknowledged subtext to all questions about atheism that does not exist with cooking or superuser'ing. </p>\n\n<p>There is a minimalist/reductionist definition of atheism being used to define the scope for questions, and it is killing the content.</p>\n\n<p>I am not posting to promote my prop on Area 51, however I think that there is an umbrella topic of <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/29214/comparative-thinking-belief-knowledge-systems?referrer=nKAzd1fMMiMOKYl-gzfdoQ2\">Comparative Studies</a> (encapsulating Philosophy, Religion, Atheism) that would better allow standards and content for questions to more distinctly emerge. Atheism on its own is too truncated a view of the topic. Semantics aside, I do not believe atheism is a negative position for many people who subscribe to it insofar as it constitutes a building block of their identity. However, to talk about it without discussing what it is defined in contradistinction to (or to assume that any question involving religion is likely off-topic) is far narrower a view than any real inquiry of any topic would allow. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/q/634/5985\">My proposal seeks to unify this realm of inquiry (Philosophy, Religion, Atheism) under one heterogeneous community</a>. In my view, the other two (and most species of religion generally, but not 'Biblical Hermeneutics') will fall into the same gambit where there are 1 or 2 other topics that are integral to the discussion, but off-topic. </p>\n\n<p>For atheism at least, only through the merger of all three of these topics can we set a context for exploring what is both (a) a very scholarly, expert-populated field of study, and (b) a difficult-to-contain-as-\"good subjective.\" What is missing (why this seems un-constructive) is a context, a setting for the Q/As over-arching discussion. By excising Religion from the site and fixating too doggedly on just atheism, perception of the historicity and lineage of this study has languished.</p>\n\n<p>I am always comfortable having my questions criticized. However, there is a default \"there is no atheist answer\" reply that many people use. For people who believe that the community of atheism is faceless, I feel they are missing an entire component of the inquiry. To not accept that atheism is a choice and creates friction in one's sense of identity is absurd. To close questions because they deal with trying to reconcile theist issues with an atheist perspective seems, on its face, like not facing issues or telling people to shut up. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is less to do with applying atheism to the stack exchange model as it is to not allowing questions to borrow from related topics.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 135, "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-17T14:59:57.860", "CommentCount": 2}

We will be inconsistent at first: it will get better and standards will be more formalized. But remember, (a) closing is not permanent, (b) all questions can be re-opened, or asked better. Even the best question or answer can still be better with a collaborative effort. The issue bigger than over-closing, is over-answering. Answering bad questions frequently  makes editing questions to be answerable almost impossible. We can occasionally harness the motives of one subjective, vote-to-close-bait question and edit it into an objectively answerable question. Answers on bad questions make editors feel sad. Editors honestly don't want to orphan your answer; also, editors don't want to deal with QQ'ing about how your answer was so great for the original question. If you answered a bad question, and it was edited into shape, you'll want to adjust your answer to fit. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I'm less worried about backlash than people being discouraged and <em>not trying to work to forge the framework</em>. It's our shared community. The community determines what flies, so test the boundaries. Try asking the same question a different way if it is closed. If you realize some way of incorporating content that was initially off-topic, share it so that we can codify the what and the why.</li>\n<li>Nobody is out <em>trying</em> to close questions, or on the prowl. Everyone knows we have a severe lack of content. Closing questions is not a productive solution. Nobody wants to close a reasonable question. BUT Sometimes, when you play the tape to the end, you notice that there are flaws that need corrected about a question. Closing a question is meant to keep people from putting up good answers to bad questions before there is a chance to rectify the flaws. Please try to promptly correct flaws or clarify questions when they are posed of your question.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": 135, "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-18T14:55:43.510"}

More members than I expected have some sort of idea of what it means to have crossed a border into atheism from where they can speak clearly about it. I don't think that border is so clear, regardless of any simple definition. People who have come to terms with it personally, frequently have a community, a family or even a spouse who has not. I think the ASE format can supply a format to have those discussions. </p>\n\n<p>A step down from that, are those who are not quite ready to declare themselves atheist. If you aren't aware of the many paths to getting there, take a look at \"50 Voices of Disbelief\". If atheists are more open and willing to accept someone who is \"on the path\" toward atheism, I think we will find more people participating in the discussion. Churches have been doing this for decades and it has helped them maintain their coffers. I am suggesting a much less subversive way of this doing this. Churches accept members who are \"on the path toward Jesus\" and give them plenty of room to not believe in miracles or participate at whatever level they want, hopefully showing up on Sunday and dropping something in the basket of course. This can be anything from a conservative church that focuses on abortion, to a liberal church that sings protest songs from the 60's and rarely mentions Jesus. </p>\n\n<p>In the Q &amp; A, this would mean opening up to someone who says they are not religious for reasons X, Y and Z, but they had a vision once, or a dream, or felt something, or read some website about quantum physics etc. and they want to ask a question about it. Sometimes these types of question may sound more combative. I see these people on the Atheist Community of Austin with Matt Dilahunty, and he almost gets them to see where they are self-justifying or fooling themselves, then he starts laying into them and saying the Bible is completely wrong and ranting about it and he can't see why they can't get it. There are plenty of sites to rant, and I don't need to be linked to \"Why is Greta Angry\" anymore. If that is what you like, then go to a site that likes that. </p>\n\n<p>If we can reach a happy medium on all of that, then I think we can have better discussion about what is part of human nature and what is imposed on us by an insidious power structure that has reproduced itself across generations. I have the same fear that Nietzsche did, that if we just say \"God is dead\", without looking at what that means, will it just result in a nihilism? Question like that, mixed with question about god's existence, and what to do for Christmas can make for a rich and interesting site. </p>\n\n<p>edit: <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/2848/negative-feelings-from-an-atheist-about-atheism\">Here is an example of something that I can't say I have ever seen on any other atheist site.

We value intellectual honesty above a false sense of purpose. But is that really true?</p>\n\n<p>As one example - to many people, one of the most offensive things that a theist can say to an atheist is that you can only be moral if you believe in God. As atheists, we are quick to reject that notion and prove that morality really comes from social norms and religion has merely adopted the same values (mostly), not dictated them. But there's always that implied and unquestioned agreement that we should be moral.</p>\n\n<p>To me, if you want to be intellectually honest all the way down, you have to recognize that there is really and truly no higher purpose to anything, which means there is no such thing as \"should\". We are here as flukes of evolution, we will live out our lives, and we will be gone. Whether people are kind or unkind to each other has only fleeting and small-scale significance, at best. More realistically, it has no significance whatsoever. In fact, the existence of the entire human race might be over in nothing but a brief moment of evolutionary time.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems that even atheists are still stuck in the pattern of trying to find significance and purpose where there is none. Bleak as it may be, the reality is that there is no purpose. If we choose to pretend that there is so that we can live \"productive\" lives, we should at least recognize that we're doing it for those reasons. Assuming of course that we really do value intellectual honesty. To me though, it just feels like the Matrix, where a few people are intentionally allowed to \"escape\" in order to foster the belief that they have beaten the system and thereby keep the system going (ignoring, of course, that the last Neo was a true singularity and really destroyed the Matrix, which I thought ruined the story). We have shed one layer of intellectual dishonesty - that our purpose comes from God - but still cling to a lower layer - that we still have a purpose.</p>\n\n<p>But why does anything matter? Why should someone who understands that there is no higher purpose waste time and energy adhering to social norms, trying to be \"good\", etc? The normal response to that is - by being a good citizen and friend, you create an environment that is better for yourself. By why does that matter? Why should I be happier with lots of friends and money than I would be as a lonely bum in an alley? Or rather, why should I care that I would be happier. And yes, society would fall apart if everyone thought this way, but you already know my answer - so what?</p>\n\n<p>The honest answer is that it doesn't matter. I would experience some \"discomfort\" as a bum in an alley, but even that is not a \"bad\" thing. It's just my brain trying to induce me to avoid a situation that reduces my chances of spreading my genes, because that's what it has evolved to do. But the only reason I try to spread my genes is that I have evolved to try to spread my genes, nothing more. And yet, none of us stop trying to live \"better\" lives. The social and genetic programming in us is much too strong for that.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the title question - are we really being honest to ourselves? Or does being atheistic help give us a false sense of being \"intellectually honest\" and allow us to avoid the question just as effectively as theists do? And is this especially true for those of us who were formerly religious and now congratulate ourselves on having broken free?</p>\n\n<p>(And I fully recognize the double hypocrisy inherent in even asking this question, and in doing it anonymously. If I truly believed that it didn't matter, I wouldn't have bothered, right?

There are centuries of thought (both secular and religious) that we can draw from in order to decide for ourselves what it is that prompts us to get out of bed each day.</p>\n\n<p>There are also plenty of questions to be asked and answered regarding the scientific alternatives to religious creation stories regarding the origins of humanity, life, Earth and the Universe in general.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ethics and Morality</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many modern legal systems are based nominally on particular religious traditions. However, most aspects of the human sense of right and wrong transcend particular belief systems and recur again and again throughout the world. Starting from basic principles of freedom, compassion, honesty and justice, there are many helpful answers to be drawn from philosophy, economics and other disciplines regarding how humans relate to each other and the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Secularism, Tolerance and Pluralism</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a particularly significant subset of ethics and morality in the modern world, the separation of Church and State is a powerful force for justice, as it requires that legal systems and government institutions be founded in basic ethical principles rather than arbitrary dictates of a controlling priesthood. However, tolerating differences in personal belief, while enforcing respect for the freedoms for others can require a delicate balancing act, both for the State and for individuals. Dealing graciously with a variety of belief systems, without allowing those belief systems to exert undue influence over science or the legal system is a challenging but necessary activity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Asking for suggestions regarding organisations, books, websites or other publications that can help with understanding any or all of the above topics is always a reasonable question.</p>\n\n<p>With so many questions related to these topics being highly personal and otherwise arguable based on starting assumptions, Atheism.SE is slightly more tolerant than most SE sites to subjective questions with no right answer. Be respectful, stay on topic and this should be fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bad Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your question includes thinly veiled (or even blatant) assumptions that all beliefs in a higher power are inherently stupid (as opposed to factually incorrect, but perfectly understandable in a social context) then it's a bad question. A meme as pervasive as belief in a higher power doesn't get that way without at least a few points in its favour (even if \"in accordance with observable reality\" isn't one of them).</p>\n\n<p>If your question is just an excuse to rant, it's a bad question.

There are questions which are too general, and general questions which apply to analyzing or critiquing method.</p>\n\n<p>An inherent difficulty with creating a general proximity agreement over this middle ground is that in order to evaluate method, all persons must agree to the ends of said method. For skepticism, they might say they agree on the end being reaching the most neutral, objective truth on the matter at hand. With atheism however, the end is not so well defined; individually, much less collectively. To say there is a particular purpose to atheism is like saying there is a purpose to not collecting stamps.

Insofar as claiming [religion has x impact], as we are neither comparative religion experts nor history experts, we are either unqualified to answer the question or the answer is off-topic anyway. Insofar as we ask what methods we use to analyze their impact, even on the most specific example, we are engaging in sharing interpretation.</p>\n\n<p><code>~~~</code> <strong>I think your question is about method</strong>. It is about <em>how</em> to perceive the impact, <em>how</em> to connect the ley lines from historical events to the religions' actions of the time. This is a question <em>about</em> history and religion, and although a question of consequence to atheists, it is not currently a question about atheism in particular or its methods. For me, to be critically and constructively about atheism and its methods, it must do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It needs to focus on a specific event (possible time period), and how to draw consequences from it </li>\n<li>These consequences should <em><a href=\"http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/349/is-anti-theism-a-valid-topic-for-this-stack-exchange/357#357\">support an anti-theist perspective</a></em> adversarial to a theist position that would otherwise expunge or ignore the impact of a religion on the event.</li>\n<li>i.e. \"What role did the Catholic Church have in the Holocaust? Was it complicit in mass genocide?\" (Note: This question allows for both sides to answer and give objective responses. It is <em>incredibly</em> argumentative and objectionable, and possibly not permissable, but if good answers can follow from more refined versions, it might actually <em>draw more people</em>)<code>*</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is why the \"Was Hitler a Catholic?\" question (or however that was posed) was on-topic. Churches seek to affiliate themselves with their best, and disassociate themselves with their worst. Setting a specific purpose to the question would turn it around; it would give meaning for anyone interested. It could be filed under <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/debate-points\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'debate-points'\" rel=\"tag\">debate-points</a> or we could come up with a new one like <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'\" rel=\"tag\">churches-gone-wild</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, this might light up the switchboards on new questions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, does this answer the question currently posed? No. However, I don't think the question is answerable. Follow-up: Should it be community wiki? Maybe, and that would change some things. If we repurpose the question, it can serve as a living repository for how different atheists think through these matters.

To be critically and constructively about atheism and its methods, and suitable for <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'\" rel=\"tag\">churches-gone-wild</a>, new questions must do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on a specific event (possibly a short time period), and how to draw consequences from it </li>\n<li>Consequences should <em>[support an anti-theist perspective][4]</em> adversarial to a theist position that would otherwise expunge or ignore the impact of a religion on the event. (<em>Or explain why anti-theism is not necessary.</em>)</li>\n<li>i.e. \"What role did the Catholic Church have in the Holocaust? Was it complicit in mass genocide?\" \n<ul>\n<li>(Note: This question allows for both sides to answer and give objective responses. It is <em>incredibly</em> argumentative and objectionable and flamebait, and possibly not permissable; but if good answers can follow from more refined versions of the question, i.e. asking about Hitler's Bishop specifically, it might actually <em>draw more people</em>)<code>*</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Not a Good Example: What did Hinduism have to do with the practice of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_%28practice%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sati</a>?\n<ul>\n<li>Too general, no specific consequence or leading action, too much room for \"IMO\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Better: What aspects of Hindu life contributed to Widows committing Sati?\n<ul>\n<li>Questions rising circumstances endemic to Hindu life, but must be restricted to the <em>religious</em> aspects in order to remain on-topic. There are limited, specific aspects of a widow's life that were <em>religiously sanctioned</em> that would lead me to commit Sati. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is why the \"Was Hitler a Catholic?\" question (or however that was posed) was on-topic. Like any mass-identity group, churches seek to affiliate themselves with their best, and disassociate themselves with their worst. These questions are for <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'\" rel=\"tag\">churches-gone-wild</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Caveat: I am having a difficulty composing a suitable, spelled out, example question that doesn't sound heinous. </p>\n  \n  <p>My primary concern with a <a href=\"http://atheism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churches-gone-wild\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'churches-gone-wild'\" rel=\"tag\">churches-gone-wild</a> question, is that if we end up with a massive amount of them, they could devolve into horrible, horrible scapegoatings, stone-thorowings, and peeing in soup. </p>\n  \n  <p>The only way of putting that in check is to use examples where there is some explicit denial on the part of a possibly culpable religion. Again, an example that comes to mind are abortion clinic bombings? I don't know, obviously this is not good or prime for front page yet, but refinements can be made once we start. Obviously this cannot just be about traffic or feeding the hate-ier sides of our egos (I, for one, do not want to participate in hateful games); but an active effort at bit by bit debunking denialism of the churches seems like a fair motive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://meta.atheism.stackexchange.com/q/399/135\">More discussion of the CGW and \"Impact of Religion\" question can be found here</a></p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 135, "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-16T19:10:52.587", "CommunityOwnedDate": "2011-03-16T19:28:47.513", "CommentCount": 5}
