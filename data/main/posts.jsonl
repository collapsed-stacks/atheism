In this debate, Boteach comes off like a Jewish Bill O'Reilly; but, they both agree on this non-trivial bet (originally proposed by Boteach) whereby the loser had to buy 100 books from the winner and distribute them to the loser's colleges. The bet was over some ruling in an Isreal rabbinical court: I'm not sure of the background of the referenced case -- feel free to clear it up.</p>\n\n<p>At 1:03 Boteach reads a statement from Hitchen's book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Speaking about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baruch Goldstein</a>, Christopher Hitchens writes while serving as a physician in the Israeli Army he had announced that he would not treat non-Jewish patients such as Isreali Arabs on the sabbath as it happens he was obeying Rabbinic law and declining not to do this, as many Israeli courts had confirmed.\" - Boteach</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Going on, he says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I challenge Mr. Hitchens to name a single Jewish court in the entire world that would ever rule that a non-Jew should not be treated on the Sabbath. In fact, if he names it I will buy a 100 copies of his book and I will give it to [...] my religious friends; but, if he fails I challenge him to buy 100 copies of my book.\" - Boteach</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At about 1:06 Boteach makes a statement to counter one of Hitchens's statements that I presume comes from his book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"That it is a slander to say, against Jews, that any Jewish court would say that non Jews should not be treated, and the state of Israel treats every single Arab and Palestinian even when terrorists are brought to hospitals.\" - Boteach</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The exchange gets quite directed at around 1:10, and the civility degrades until the conclusion of the pissing contest.

Most often, historically, the question has been asked as a philosophical one. Which is a different thing altogether. </p>\n\n<p>Philosophy provides many tools to answer this question, only one of which is Logic. It is obviously to be answered negatively using classical logical reasoning. But there are philosophical paths which can legitimately, following all of their rules and standards, answer it positively. </p>\n\n<p>You will find, for example, that it makes perfect sense from a post modern relativistic point of view to suppose there may well be a god or gods. These discussions must be answered by questioning the validity of the methodology itself, instead of engaging in it's style of discussion, the same goes the other way 'round of course.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If we allow every kind of reasoning, we will get every possible answer.

From a strict scientific point of view, there is no god until we get more evidence. <strong>This we don't take on faith any more than gravity or evolution</strong>.

Otherwise, you needn't take them seriously. You need not, as you may think at first, disprove their assertions.</p>\n\n<p>One must be careful to keep in mind that one is refusing to accept an assertion, rather than making one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In practice</strong>, arguments that lack of religious belief is based on <em>faith</em> often rely on misconceptions and fallacies about science.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just one example:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The scientific principle of falsifiability must apply and if not answered, renders the question unscientific. Here's the fallacy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>An unanswerable question is one that you can answer \"any way you like\"</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>An argument employing this fallacy is easily contradicted. And I'll assert that many of the <em>\"atheists are believers too\"</em>-arguments are employing it. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And here's the logical proof to refute it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>if a question is unanswerable, it can (a) have no knowable answers or (b) have no answers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a: There is no way prove any answer, therefore the correctness of no answer can be established, therefore no answer is found to be correct,</p></li>\n<li><p>b: There are no answers, therefore there are no right answers,</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>therefore every answer is to be considered wrong.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Or to put it in context, if we can't know there is no god (which hasn't been established here remember), we must assume there is no god, until further evidence is provided or the prerequisites to the question change.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 47, "LastEditorUserId": 47, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-03-14T16:43:54.510", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-14T16:43:54.510", "CommentCount": 8}

As an atheist you may expect me to say no; but if I'm being honest, I'd have to consider myself a spiritual person. Of course I'm not talking about some ghostly ethereal soul that lives inside my body. There's no reason to think there's anything like that. I'm talking about the essence of human. There aren't many words in our language that capture what that is. at least for me. And so I use the word spirit, in the same way I use the phrase bless you. For rhetoric's sake. I can only describe it as the action or ability to see beauty. to feel wonder. and to be in awe.</p>\n  \n  <p>Religion and all groups faith of course serve only to prostitute the awe, and the mystery we all feel as humans. they bottle our essence and try putting lid on the wonder we naturally feel. They fail of course. Religion points to the man behind the curtain in an attempt answer the mystery. when in reality, there is no man. the mystery is just that. a mystery.</p>\n  \n  <p>But even though I don't believe in the supernatural, I try to be as honest as I can to myself, about my spirituality.</p>\n  \n  <p>On my trip out west just a couple months ago I remember a moment standing in a field that looked up at the grand tetons. the tetons in wyoming are these massive glacier capped mountains that just cut into the sky. I remember thinking to myself. Something much greater than me must have caused this. I know it.</p>\n  \n  <p>I also remember sleeping out underneath a cool and clear sky next to the dunes in white sands national park. Looking up all I could see was just a pile of stars. More than I'd ever understood to exist. Looking at them all, still and perfect, and vast beyond my ability to comprehend, I felt uncommonly humble. And grateful just to be alive.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are moments when I'm with good friends, where it just feels good to breath. The taste of chilled apple butter on a warm buttermilk biscuit is often more than delicious, to me it feels enlightening. And a soft kiss to me can honestly stop time and space.</p>\n  \n  <p>At times I can be so overwhelmed by the sensation of being alive, that I cry. or I laugh. or I scream. or I just breath deeply.</p>\n  \n  <p>And no, I never once imagine that to be supernatural. I understand, that the thing that is so much greater than me, to have caused the Tetons has a name. and it's called plate tectonics.</p>\n  \n  <p>That being humble is simply the feeling of recognizing the reality of ones small significance to a universe so massive. And being grateful to be alive doesn't require a person to be grateful toward. </p>\n  \n  <p>I recognize that being happy in a comfortable social setting is a evolutionary trait of my species. That my body naturally craves specific foods for nutritional or maybe even psychological reasons. And that the intoxication of romance is most likely driven by the need to procreate.</p>\n  \n  <p>But I am one with the universe. Not metaphysically, but physically. I am as much the universe as a supernova. made of the same particles, governed by the same forces. I am Genes that mutated randomly, then were selected naturally based on their success at survival.</p>\n  \n  <p>And I love applebutter on a biscuit. I collapse in awe at the magnificence of this place. I crave romance. and I breath appreciation for it all..</p>\n  \n  <p>I have to, with all my essence. with all my spirit. because imagine, in all the universe, we may be the only things that can, and that's beautiful.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": 74, "LastEditorUserId": 675, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-02T06:48:38.303", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-02T06:48:38.303", "CommentCount": 4}

What is \"religion\"?  What is \"an illness\"?</p>\n\n<p>Taking on the latter question first, I'm having trouble pinpointing the etymological derivation of \"illness\", so I'm hoping you won't object to me picking up a different word: \"disease\".  The etymology here is quite evident: dis-, meaning without, and ease.  A discomfort, a difficulty, etc.  When I think about \"mental illness\" in terms of \"disease\" in this sense, what comes to me is a question of whether the \"illness\" is creating distress in someone's life.  For example, the so-called Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (note the similarity between disorder and disease) has, as one major feature (for at least some diagnosed as such) of hyperactivity.  Is hyperactivity a (or does hyperactivity cause) disease?  I think that really depends on the person, and, importantly, on their environment.</p>\n\n<p>For a kid in a classroom whose teacher wants everyone still, it's a problem to be hyperactive.  For the same kid out on the playground with the other kids during recess, it might not be, at all.  And for that same kid, grown up, later in life, it may depend a great deal on how they occupy their time: if they're a professional comedian, for example, it might actually be a huge benefit to their chosen occupation.  So, is it a disease?  Well, it might be, if it also causes problems in other areas of their life.  But again, this may be more a function of their environment than some inherent notion that hyperactivity is \"bad\" or \"an illness\" or something.  If we change \"hyperactive\" to \"energetic\", surely \"energetic\" is a useful thing in all manner of environments, yes?  And yet, it's probably not the best feature to have while in an opera audience, say.  Or at a funeral.  Or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>There is a huge amount of context-dependency for questions such as this, which I think too often gets ignored by our society.</p>\n\n<p>Are \"religious people\" \"ill\", or \"diseased\"?  I don't know, I think it depends on how you look at it: they probably find \"ease\" from their religion, when at church, say.  They may have difficulty with it at other times.  Similarly, an atheist may well have a \"disease\" when surrounded by religious people -- not because they're \"ill\", but because they're ill-matched to their environment.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question I would be asking is: given the presumption (which I'm sure many religious people would disagree with) that atheism (and various world views that tend frequently to flow from it) is something more inline with \"truth\" than religious beliefs, and another presumption (which I think the religious people would mostly agree with) that knowing the \"truth\" is a useful thing: How can we find ways to cause religion <em>to be</em> a \"dis-ease\", and atheism to <em>not be</em> one?</p>\n\n<p>Does that help you answer (or at least have new thoughts regarding) your question?</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 143, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-14T22:52:29.970", "CommentCount": 4}

Then there are the hard ones- crack, heroin, the KKK and the Jehadis.  They have tremendous appeal for people in a vulnerable state, but rarely let go once they've got their claws in.  These are the types you really hope your kids never get mixed up with.  They kill routinely, they take over and then ruin lives.  </p>\n\n<p>We shouldn't be upset at the guy getting his second cup of coffee for the day because a drunk driver ran over our friend.

They've been sucking in people by the millions for two-thousand years, and making 'em pay 30% of their income for the privilege.

YES.</p>\n\n<p>On an individual basis, and within an individual's set of opinions on different subjects, there will be a mix of skeptical and credulous thinking.  Everyone is using Bill Maher as an example.  Fine.  The type-specimen of compartmentalized thinking, next to Francis Collins.  It's too easy to use outliers as \"evidence\" that a general premise is false.  How many evolution deniers point to difficult-to-explain outliers in order to claim evolutionary theory is wrong?  Do you want to join their camp in making this error in thinking?  How many arguments against atheism go something like, \"Pol Pot and Stalin were atheist, therefore Atheism causes murders.\"  Arguments from individuals will give you bad answers.</p>\n\n<p>I think this question needs to be answered from a statistical perspective, thinking about populations, rather than looking for individual counter-examples and then discarding the premise.  </p>\n\n<p>So from a population perspective, I would hypothesize \"YES, Skepticism is a statistically significant contributor, or defining factor in those who self-identify as atheists.\"  It is ESPECIALLY true (again, conjecture, but definitely testable) that with regards to arriving at atheism, skepticism is almost universally employed.</p>\n\n<p>I have a fairly broad tolerance for what I consider \"skepticism\" here.  It basically means having the ability to recognize and act on cognitive dissonance, and be willing to discard former truths for new conclusions, based on evidence.  That \"trait\" seems to be almost universal in those who identify as atheist.</p>\n\n<p>It is the opposite of credulity and faith:  Believing and accepting everything told to you without asking any questions, and retaining the belief in spite of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Example:  A believer's mother dies of cancer at a young age, and he says, \"I no longer believe in God... I prayed for a cure, it did not arrive.  I watch pricks get cancer and survive while my mother is killed... there is no Divine justice.  My mother suffered immensely, there is no compassionate or loving god.\"  </p>\n\n<p>This person isn't applying a rigorously argued technical skepticism, but he <strong><em>is</em></strong> recognizing and acting on \"cognitive dissonance\" to decide against that which he has been trained to believe is absolute truth.  Skepticism, if applied to religious ideas without reservation, DOES lead to atheism.  It is only the people who refuse to allow themselves to think skeptically on some topics who retain silly beliefs in those topics.</p>\n\n<p><em>For those who don't particularly like this formulation, please sketch me realistic counter examples of how someone could arrive at atheism without applying skeptical, critical thought.</em>  (And don't just say \"everyone is born an atheist, having yet to think at all.

I don't\n  remember exactly when I started using\n  it, and unfortunately lost my mailer\n  that would have contained the archive.\n  The earliest records that DejaNews.com\n  have is back to 1995, and by October\n  1995 it apeared 'widespread' in\n  taglines, so I must have originated it\n  sometime before then.

I used the a similar\n  comparison in a debate when my\n  opponent wondered why I ignored the\n  evidence for god, and in return, I\n  wondered why my debate opponent chose\n  to ignore the evidence for Shiva, or\n  Zeus, or any of the other possible\n  gods.</p>\n  \n  <p>...I then slightly refined and\n  shortened it the next day to the\n  'modern' form it is now to use in a\n  tagline. Within days, The Quote was in\n  use by others in their taglines (I\n  added my name as an attribute a few\n  weeks later when people asked me if it\n  was my original quote).</p>\n  \n  <p>...About a month later, I made another\n  variation of the quote that also\n  appears sometimes: \"We are all\n  atheists, some of us just believe in\n  fewer gods than others\"... but it\n  never quite got the popularity of the\n  original :-)</p>\n  \n  <p>Since that time, I've occasionally\n  ego-surfed to see how the quote has\n  moved out around the world.</p>\n  \n  <p>Interestingly, as the quote moved out,\n  it seemed to become attributed to\n  \"other\" Stephen Robertses.

It is only insofar as it does that a believer has any right to seek to suppress it in a pluralistic society (the very same society which provides the believer with the space to make up his own mind about his own beliefs). By threat I don't mean discomfort, or even disgust. I don't mean some vague sense of otherness. I mean an actual threat to life and/or livelihood. That is usually the criteria we use in a just society to justify the suppression of some behaviour. This is usually where believers pull a series of fabricated or dishonest statistics to point to the destructive nature of homosexuality (so they break the rule you set out in your question). But there is simply no evidence they can provide, which holds in the face of examination, that homosexuality can possibly be a threat to their lives.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of livelihood, some believers might here argue that since their livelihood is tied in to the suppression of homosexuality, the existence of that homosexuality constitutes a threat. I would counter-argue that if homosexuality did not exist, that believers livelihood would be far more threatened, since he would have to find another target or go out of business altogether. So by being successful in suppressing homosexuality, the anti-gay believer might put himself out of business.</p>\n\n<p>But even beyond the suppression of homosexual behaviour, if that were ever even possible, there's the question of whether homosexuality is a behaviour or an identity (or both). Some have made the point for the case where we consider homosexuality an identity; much as I would agree with that, believers argue from the definition of homosexuality as behaviour.

The times when I consider myself an antitheist are often the net result of my distaste for the teachings of conservative religions as relates to sex and sexuality.  And it manifests itself in a lot of different ways:</p>\n\n<p>-- being opposed to all birth control.  In other words, they want to instill a fear of either pregnancy or disease that causes people, while simultaneously encouraging organic growth of the faith through a large number of births</p>\n\n<p>-- treating gays as second class citizens.  This one makes no sense to me whatsoever.  Depending on how you read the bible, there's anywhere from one to three verses that say not to engage in gay sex.  In the entire bible.  (And for reference, the Bible lists more things that you shouldn't eat and/or more ways by which you shouldn't prepare them.)

Knowledge informs the degree to which one will be willing to act on a belief, based on past results/evidence.  In other words Knowledge helps us avoid taking stupid actions based on \"mere\" belief.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supporting argument and assumptions</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Belief is an agreement to a truth claim, which you are then willing to act upon.\nExample from previous conversation, \"I believe my wife loves me.  She says so, and as yet has not violated any of the criteria by which I define the word, and so for the day I will stay married (action) and reciprocate my love for her (action).\"  </p>\n\n<p>A Belief (and the action which makes it tangible/real) <em>always</em> carries the following characteristic:  <br><strong>There are absolutely NO guarantees that your belief will align with results that will occur.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Example:  I could hold the belief, \"I can jump from this rock to that rock\" and then ACT on the belief.  Midair, I truly believe the proposition...i.e., it is a belief.  And yet, having acted says nothing about the outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Knowledge is a confirmed belief, but it is provisional: based on the results of the action, in no way guaranteed to recur (no matter how many times it has in the past), and agreed upon by the interpretation of observers who share your terminology.  Knowledge is peer reviewed. (Let's not devolve into a total philosophical hole about whether or not there is any shared reality.)</p>\n\n<p>If I make the jump from one rock to another, and fall short in the grass, the following becomes true:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>I KNOW (provisionally, for this one test) that I can <em>not</em> jump from one rock to the other.</p></li>\n<li><p>I could CLAIM to know that my belief is true, and that I really CAN jump from one rock to another, but based on the evidence, that would be a claim about a future test... i.e., it's back to being a belief.

You have to \"believe\" in yourself!)</p></li>\n<li><p>I could claim that I DID make the leap, and that therefore I KNOW I can... but this would not hold up to peer review.

I realized it bothered me because of the religious connotations - i.e. \"God made them the sex they are, they should be that gender\" - which is completely and utterly rediculous.  Once I realized that, it stopped being a question for me.</p>\n\n<p>Personal anecdotes aside, those whom I see as Rationalists, whose numbers seem to be larger amongst Atheists, seem to be more accepting.  As one other person answering said, \"as long as it doesn't hurt someone else\" and \"consenting adults\" - those are the keys in my mind.  I have found most other Atheists I know (all 4 or 5 of them) to be in agreement with me on this.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if this is too meandering of an answer.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 244, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-22T19:11:18.547"}

Suppose we abbreviated Heinlein's whole sentence as \"Tldtsiawsdi!\" so that the entire explanation can be conveyed in one word; better yet, we'll give it a short arbitrary label like \"Fnord!\"  Does this reduce the complexity?  No, because you have to tell the listener in advance that \"Tldtsiawsdi!\" stands for \"The lady down the street is a witch; she did it.\"  \"Witch\", itself, is a label for some extraordinary assertions - just because we all know what it means doesn't mean the concept is simple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": 106, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-22T21:20:45.140"}

I don't know if that's possible, because Occam's razor is widely misunderstood and misapplied. The only good refutation is have an adequate understanding of what he meant and how it applies in the eral world.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of things to consider here:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reducing Assumptions</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's start with the fancy technical definition of occam's razor, which has two parts:</p>\n\n<p>1) \"For nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture\". In other words, if you affirm the truth of something, you need to have a good reason for it.</p>\n\n<p>2) \"Plurality should not be assumed without necessity\" It means that if you can adequately describe something without making an assumption, then you should exclude the assumption from your description since it clearly adds no useful information. Note that including or excluding the assumption does not make it more or less true, just more concise.</p>\n\n<p>Occam probably would not have agreed with the statement atheism is a simpler explanation than theism. He was a product of his times and believed his conception of God is the only logically necessary being in the universe. I think that belief now is a little more controversial than it would have been in the 1300s.</p>\n\n<p>Occam's razor is essentially a rejection of \"blind faith\" -- you shouldn't believe in something by conviction alone, you need to have a good <em>reason</em> for your conviction, otherwise you have no claim to knowledge. A good reason starts with logic (ontology) or experience (epistemology).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Parsimony</strong></p>\n\n<p>Parsimony means \"be frugal in your explanations\". In relation to religion and science, it seems that the universe we have no is fundamentally indistinguishable and consistent with philosophical materialism. It seems odd to talk about the universe with the inclusion of paranormal entities like gods and avatars, parallel spirit universes comprising an after life, etc. The mechanics of the universe are evidently unchanged by the inclusion of these elements (at least in so far as they remain wholly invisible and seem not to interact with the universe), so why bring them up in theories of the universe at all?</p>\n\n<p>With that said, its important to keep in mind that excluding supernatural beings from descriptions of the universe is <em>not</em> the same thing as stating that do not or cannot exist.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Explanatory power</strong></p>\n\n<p>We can trade away simplicity for a gain in explanatory power and accuracy. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The early Ptolemaic picture of the solar system put the earth in the center with all the planets orbiting around in perfect circles.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, calculations of planet's actual motion did not match up with predictions from the perfect circle model, a model was created in which planets orbit in small perfect circles and the focal point of the planetary orbit traced perfect circles around the earth. The smaller circle was called the epicycle, and the end result was a much more accurate prediction of planetary motion.</li>\n<li>However, the model with epicycles is only accurate for a very short period of time, after which the margin of inaccuracy grows to the point that epicycles are no longer adequate to explain planetary motion. So, a model was constructed which was epicycles on top of epicycles, which helped, but only temporarily. As inaccuracies are discovered, astronomers attempt to model epicycles on epicyles (up to 60 or 80 circles in circles).</li>\n<li>Later observations and predictions by Copernicus abandoned the earth-centered model in favor of a sun-centered model, where planets orbit around the sun in epicycles (on the order about about 20 or 30).</li>\n<li>Tycho Brahe refined the heliocentric model by providing evidence against \"immutable celestial spheres\", he described the motion of comets and supernova which have motions outside and separate from the solar system.</li>\n<li>Kepler went a step further, and while attempting to simplify the epicycles on epicycles theory, he discovered planetary motion could be modeled with ellipses where the sun formed one focal point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So what does Occam's razor have to say about this? Well, I'm pretty sure that the move from perfect circles to epicycles to epicycles on epicycles is justified by Occam's razor, not because the explanation kept getting <em>simpler</em>, but because each refined model because more <em>accurate</em>. Each explanation could do more than the previous one.</p>\n\n<p>Its really an accident that Kepler's model is \"simpler\" (however simplicity is measured) than the other models, but had it been incorrect, we'd really have no reason to prefer it over one with infinite epicycles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Choosing between explanations</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now, continuing the line of thought above, let's say that we have two mutually exclusive explanations for an observation. It's not a matter of excluding one explanation because it includes superfluous entities, but really that both explanations account for the same observation in wholly different ways. To use an example, let's take <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uri Gellar</a> as an example: he claimed to have paranormal powers which were given to him by extraterrestrials, which ranged from telepathy, telekinesis, and famously the ability to mentally bend spoons and keys from behind a magic cloth.</p>\n\n<p>There are two competing claims: that Uri Gellar really has paranormal powers, or he's using a sleight of hand technique no different than magicians use everyday. Needless to say, Mr Gellar has unable to bend keys in scientific environments, or bend keys behind a cloth when those keys were sitting on a glass table being watched by a camera.</p>\n\n<p>Proofs are for math, but [i]accumulation of evidence[/i] is for science. In this case, when testing both theories, evidence in favor of Mr Gellar's actual paranormal powers dwindled in favor of the sleight of hand explanation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What to Test First</strong></p>\n\n<p>A handy consequence of Occam's razor is how, if we have to make a choice between testing two competing hypotheses, it seems \"simplest\" hypothesis is roughly equivalent to the one we can test most quickly. If I had a theory which could be verified in 5 minutes with a two bars of soap and a matchstick, or verified by 100 years of studying theoretical physics and building a massive hadron collider positioned on the moon, any self-respecting scientist will say \"use the soap!\".</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, we'd be more likely to approach a claim of telepathy by putting two people in separate rooms and attempting to have a sender communicate information to a receiver. We'd be unlikely to approach the situation by scanning the atmosphere for minute perturbations in EMF signals marking the telepathic transmission.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theism and Occam's Razor</strong></p>\n\n<p>Occam's razor states that, in order to make a claim of theism, that there should be <em>good reasons</em> to postulate the existence of gods, and that the inclusion of God is a useful contribution to observations we see, and that the inclusion of God provides more accurate explanatory power that non-god explanations.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 318, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-22T23:48:09.600"}

Instead, in matters of criminal law, as per Article 3 of the \"Law of the Source of Law\" (one of the six fundamental laws adopted upon ratification of the Lateran Treaty in 1929) the Vatican State generally uses current Italian national law, as well as regional and municipal laws for Rome, as long as they do not conflict with ecclesiastical law or laws specifically promulgated by Pope for the Vatican.<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/vatican.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">39</a>]</sup> As a result, the age of consent is the same as that of Italy. Before January 1, 2009, the adoption by the Vatican of changes made by Italy in its laws was automatic. Effective January 1, 2009, the Vatican adoption of changes in Italian law is no longer automatic but comes into effect only after a review.<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4BU3BD20081231\" rel=\"nofollow\">40</a>]</sup> However, as Italy adopted its present age of consent before January 1, 2009, this change in Vatican policy does not affect the age of consent in Vatican City, which remains the same as that of Italy. <strong>The claim is sometimes found that \"In the Vatican State, there is an equal age of consent set at 12 years of age\",<sup>[<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2008/12/vatican_opposes_un_declaration.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">41</a>]</sup> <em>but this is not correct</em>. The misunderstanding derives from the fact that Vatican Law follows Italian law. In 1929, when the Lateran Treaty was signed, the age of consent in Italy was 12,<sup>[<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=cc8nAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">42</a>]</sup> and so the same was true then in Vatican City. However, since that time the Italian law has been changed, and so the laws of Vatican City (in accordance with the policy that was in place until January 1, 2009) changed automatically with them.</strong> Since there has been no change in the Italian age of consent since January 1, 2009, the two remain identical with no further review by the Vatican.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Age of consent in Italy is 14, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#Italy\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to the same article</a>.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 27, "LastEditorUserId": 27, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-23T10:43:53.550", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-23T10:43:53.550"}

What allowed me to stop being a devout Catholic and transition to non-belief?  I have asked your question in a slightly different way by saying, \"What would be the \"inoculation\" meme that could help a \"religious-mind-virus\" infected person form some antibodies and eventually recover?\"</p>\n\n<p>It took me many years of working through it, so a pat answer is not easy, but here are the conclusions I currently think are useful</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.  What if?</strong>  This idea can undermine most dogma, but the believer has to advance to a stage where they let themselves question things they have been told they must not question.  I eventually allowed myself this tactic, when I could not reconcile inconsistent dogma, practice or attitudes.  </p>\n\n<p>Different questions for different folks, but here are a couple that really got the ball of non-belief rolling when I was still a believer.</p>\n\n<p>What If the bible isn't verbatim dictated by God?  What would I have to reconsider? What parts of the world would suddenly collapse?\nWhat If I am the only person in my life capable of discerning \"God's Will\" for me... even if I consult a mentor, or the bible... I ultimately am the ONLY one deciding?  What if there IS no God's will for me, and it's all just me making choices?</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.  Seek Consistent thought:</strong>  The believer (all of us, for that matter) need to pay attention when something just doesn't seem right.  Play with the niggling doubts you run into.  Seek consistency across your whole worldview, and when you find yourself saying something like \"I can't continue pursuing this thought, because it violates my faith,\" the believer has to be comfortable asking the \"Why\" and \"What If\" questions... Why can't this area be made consistent? Says who?  Why are they saying it?  What \"would be\" the consistent position here?  Why would that be bad?</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.  You're not alone:</strong>  It's a lot less difficult in the internet age, but at the time I was \"de-converting\" I had the pervasive sense that I might be the first person who had ever left his faith. :-)  I exaggerate, but the believer will think they are alone, and they might even be told by family that they will be abandoned.  Don't sweat it. That kind of emotional blackmail is indicative of a bad reason to stay in any group/mindset.  Let your friend know there are LOTS of good places to turn for more information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.  It Gets Better.</strong>  (with a tip of the hat to Dan Savage's \"It Gets Better\" campaign). Based on my experiences, it was a tough couple of years of re-structuring my thinking before I truly got comfortable with the implications of atheism.  It is because a believer must uproot foundations of their former model of thought.  Tell your friend don't be afraid...talk, ask questions, keep thinking.  The world will go on, and you WILL eventually realize that the fear you are feeling NOW, on the cusp of leaving beliefs behind, evaporates over time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Ya Gotta Want It:</strong>  The believer, implicitly or explicitly, is asking \"Why would I WANT to give up my lifelong friend, spiritual comfort, community?\"  If you can help them see that \"our way of life\" is desirable, enjoyable, fulfilling, sufficient, that will help them loosen the grip on the thing they perceive as their life raft. (Another useful analogy, to help YOUR approach, is to recognize that a life-long believer is in some ways like an abused spouse.  The psychology of staying with an abuser is deep, but at its core is the assumption, \"The devil I know is better than the devil I don't.\" We MUST help someone seeking escape see that there are better alternatives out here.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.  Share some ridicule and laughter:</strong> This one I have only recently come to consider valuable.  A well done, insightful, non-attacking bit of comedy can really quickly establish the \"dissonance\" that is the motivation for someone to re-consider deeply held beliefs.  Use your judgment, but I have found a bunch of Tim Minchin's satirical songs to be wickedly funny and they expose some core faith ideas to appropriate ridicule.  Germane to my \"What if the Bible isn't dictated by God?\"  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxXrTRFVUkQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">I recommend Tim's \"The Good Book.\"</a>  Apologies to any pants-wetting caused. :-)  </p>\n\n<p><strong>7.  It's their journey.</strong> , if asked your opinion on specific, difficult issues that the person is currently trying to navigate, give your perspective while avoiding an attack on the belief system or Religion as a whole.  They have to understand that it is their journey and choice to change. If they ultimately want to, it will be their choice, not because you rammed arguments down their throat.</p>\n\n<p>Matter of fact explanations, \"Well, this is why XYZ doesn't seem to make sense to me...\" will help, without setting off the deeply ingrained, heavily evolved defense mechanisms embedded in most religions. The defense mechanisms of this virus are deeply rooted... partially in total demands to give one's life to the faith, and partially in self-containing circular logic evolved to keep the flock from noticing there are significant gaps in the fence.  </p>\n\n<p>If you're going to be \"fishers of men,\" then you don't want to scare the fish.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 149, "LastEditorUserId": 149, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-23T16:11:21.633", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-23T16:11:21.633", "CommentCount": 10}

You're effectively saying that everything that can possibly be done has been done, and all that's left is to wait until the outcome comes out.

The argument regarding whether its a choice is a total red herring.</p>\n\n<p>The correct approach here is to ask \"why is homosexuality immoral\". Its pretty obvious why things like theft and murder are wrong, because they harm people in a very tangible way, but the wrongfulness of homosexuality escapes people. There are no secular explanations for how it differs in any way, shape, or form from consentual heterosexuality.</p>\n\n<p>Until you get an answer, which you won't, you really need to hammer on the point that people who disapprove of homosexuality don't have rational reasons for doing so. In the process, you're going to get a lot of red-herring, nonsense answers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"They can't reproduce\" -- nevermind the fact that voluntarily childless people, asexuals, extremely old, are unlikely to reproduce, where's the <em>harm</em>, where's the part that makes the behavior morally objectionable?</li>\n<li>\"Its not natural!\" -- who cares, where's the <em>harm</em>, the immorality?</li>\n<li>\"They have AIDS!\" -- and heterosexuality contact is the most common form of transmission in Africa, therefore its bad, right? Errm. Preaching safe sex and condom use does an infinite amount more than preaching against homosexuality. Now, why is homosexuality immoral?</li>\n<li>\"They molest children!\" -- you ever listen to actual things pedophiles say? Ever attempted to find a member of the community and listen to them? Understand their motives?  \"Offenders attracted to boy victims typically report that they are uninterested in or revulsed by adult homosexual relationships and find the young boy's <em>feminine characteristics</em> ... appealing\" (<a href=\"http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gayscience.html#myths\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>). The study continues \"pedophiles that were attracted to both children and adults (51%), 83% were exclusively heterosexuals, and 17% were bisexual.  [...] In yet another study at the Children's Hospital in San Diego, of the 140 boys presenting with sexual abuse, <em>only 4% of the assaults were by homosexuals</em>\". Remember, for decades, there has been a stigma against gays, and there has been a tendency to categorize male-on-male abuse as homosexual without assessing the offenders actual sexual orientation. An overwhelming majority of sex offenders and pedophiles are heterosexual men, and attraction to children is a paraphilia that is otherwise separate from a person's sexual orientation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The list of reasons goes on and on and on, and every one of them will avoid addressing how or why homosexuality is immoral. That is, until you get down the ultimate answer:</p>\n\n<p><strong>BECAUSE GOD DISAPPROVES OF IT!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well... why does god disapprove of homosexuality? I'm sure being infinitely intelligent and having access to all moral philosophy past, present, future, and otherwise, if he thinks its immoral, he could just -- and I hope this isn't too much to ask -- tell us why. So, why <em>does</em> God think its immoral, where is the <em>harm</em>? Now we're right back where we started.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Super Gross!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The more and more you pressure a person to just simply explain, in plain unobfuscated terms, why they believe there's something wrong with homosexuality, the more you'll find there is no reason.</p>\n\n<p>At least in my interaction with bigots, I've found a good number of them are happy to admit that their opposition is non-rational, that they oppose homosexuality because <em>they themselves</em> are no attracted to the same sex. The argument against homosexuality is as simple as this: two dudes kissing is totally super gross!</p>\n\n<p>They find it gross, disgusting, and they extremely uncomfortable with the subject. Its true, most heteros are totally disinterested or even grossed out by the idea of personally having sex with someone of the same gender. But, compare these two attitudes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most people find same-sex experiences unsettling state that they won't ever engage in those experiences.</li>\n<li>Bigots who find same-sex experience unsettling state that they won't engage in them, and neither should <em>you</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Homophobes thing that a private, personal rule that works for them (i.e. not having gay sex) is a general rule that applies to everyone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will <em>never</em> get a better answer than \"its gross\" from someone who opposes homosexuality -- it just won't happen.</p>\n\n<p>Except as a psychological curiosity, it doesn't matter whether homosexuality and heterosexuality are learned behaviors.

In my experience, this is no easy task given the defense mechanisms that religion embeds upon it's adherents, often starting from a very early age.  It's important to recognize that you're unlikely to make highly religious people give up their beliefs, identities and rituals so your goals should be modest.  Sure, helping a theist become an atheist would be wonderful but just empowering a believer with stronger critical thinking skills is what ought to matter most.  </p>\n\n<p>To do so, you should be mindful of who you choose to influence.  I think this is even more important than the methods employed.  There are some who are incredibly stubborn, unreflective and deficient when it comes to objective thinking.  In my experience, the people worth influencing need to be fairly intelligent and it helps if they're educated.  Those with a liberal arts education have a background that provides a basis in critical analysis while those with a science education should have a firm grasp of objectivity and the scientific method.  People need to learn the value of truth, seeing diverse perspectives, as well as the merits of logic and the basic fallacies.  Of course, these kinds of backgrounds aren't essential but they do provide a good leg up.</p>\n\n<p>Critical thinking skills can be discussed without getting into religion.  While there are some who are willing to debate and/or listen to arguments and prescriptions for skepticism, most theists avoid such challenges.  I know several who despised the likes of Dawkins and Harris and would immediately tune out of anything they had to say.  Over time, you can eventually lure them back into the debate but it takes some philosophical building blocks and subtle chipping away at the defenses to do so.  </p>\n\n<p>It's uncomfortable for someone to hear ideological advice from a peer. Fortunately, there is plenty of media that can challenge a believer's defenses without ruining a relationship.  The media spectrum ranges from gentle messages to in-your-face confrontation.  Movies, books, television, blogs and music can illustrate the diversity of ideology, sympathy for different viewpoints, as well as the immorality of dogma and prejudice.  For those who have a sense of humour, one of the best chisels is comedy.  Atheist comedians, such as George Carlin, Ricky Gervais and Bill Maher, may be blunt but the hilarity of absurdity is hard for even strong theists to resist.  Exposure to the right types of media can plant seeds of doubt in the minds of believers and shape tolerance for different ideas.</p>\n\n<p>I expect that a typical theist won't lose his/her religion on account of such media but he/she will likely face cognitive dissonance on some level.  That is key to bringing the theist into a reality where he/she is able to question beliefs.  Once a believer is willing to accept internal challenges, doors are open for conversation or even argumentation that can alter his/her preconceptions.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 112, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-23T18:04:52.610", "CommentCount": 1}

It would suggest that a tendency to accept appeals to authority as justifications for belief is fairly universal. While the epistemologists present might bristle at this claim, I do think appeals to authority can be reasonable at least for functional belief for the purpose of guides behavior. For one example that shows my hand a bit, not all of us can be climate scientists but that doesn't mean that we should not believe in global warming and adjust our behavior accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, then the difference lies in which domains individuals are willing to accept appeals to authority rather than a simple rejection thereof. Importantly, one of the nice things about empirical observation is that experiments, at least <em>ideally</em>, are repeatable and observable by outside parties. These properties generally are not present in many religious beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Still though, it may be that atheists end up having more veritable belief systems, by virtue of their appealing exclusively to scientific claims, but that does not mean that they require a <strong>different level or type</strong> of evidence. <em>That</em> would require a deeper understanding of the positive qualities of science. And while many atheists may have such understanding, we cannot yet prove that all of them do or even that a majority do.</p>\n\n<p>An efficient and functionally useful heuristic of that true understanding is to simply state that if a scientist says it, then the statement is probably true, and if an explanation appeals to supernatural forces, then it is probably false prima facie, and is the result of a testable relation between the phenomenon in question that simply hasn't yet been discovered. If people can get by on this, and scientists are trustworthy enough to keep check on each other's credibility (which the peer review system helps enforce) then this heuristic will be pretty solid.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 404, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-23T19:28:23.273", "CommentCount": 4}

Even more precisely, there is a strong positive correlation with female gender identification and positively responding to \"Is there a God?\", \"Is there life after death?\", whether God answers prayers, whether ghosts and esp exist, and whether astrology is valid  (Rice, 2003 \"Believe It Or Not: Religious and Other Paranormal Beliefs in the United States\" <em>Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion</em>, 42(1)).

It is a fallacy to think that only \"nature\" affects neurochemistry; we are shaped by our environments, which includes all of our experiences, be they biological(genetic) or social(cultural). </p>\n\n<p><strong>CRAZY HYPOTHESES ENDED</strong></p>\n\n<p>Returning to the question about prominent females in atheism, I have no idea why we don't hear about them more often, since, as always everything is a distribution and there are clearly brilliant female atheists even if on average women are more religious. It's a very interesting question, but not one to be answered by simply denying the gender differences that do exist.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 404, "LastEditorUserId": 404, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-10T23:17:53.533", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-10T23:17:53.533", "CommentCount": 3}

But if ultimately what atheism is is more along the lines of 2a), i.e. a statement of belief, not one of knowledge, does that mean that such beliefs must be justified? What is the nature of that justification? I realize this discussion may take things slightly off topic so I will start a new post, but I <em>do</em> think this is an issue relevant to the definition of atheism, since it depends largely on whether atheism is purely a statement of belief or knowledge or whether it is merely a doctrine as in 2b).</p>\n\n<p>The American Atheists define it as such:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"What is atheism?\" is usually the one\n  question never asked of most atheists.\n  Most people do not ask this question\n  because they already have their own\n  ideas about what atheism is and what\n  atheists are. Where these ideas\n  originate vary.</p>\n  \n  <p>Older dictionaries define atheism as\n  \"a belief that there is no God\" and/or\n  \"denial of God.\" Some dictionaries go\n  further and say that atheism is\n  \"wickedness,\" \"sinfulness,\"\n  \"heathenism,\" \"paganism,\" and\n  \"immorality.\" Some dictionaries even\n  say that atheism is the \"doctrine that\n  there is no God.\" At least The\n  American Heritage \u00ae Dictionary says\n  \"God and gods\" after the word\n  \"doctrine,\" but that does not detract\n  from the fact that use of the word\n  doctrine is incorrect.</p>\n  \n  <p>The fact that the dictionary's\n  definition uses the phrase \"there is\n  no God\" betrays the theistic influence\n  in defining the word atheism. If\n  dictionaries did not contain such\n  influence, then the definition would\n  read, \"A belief that there are no\n  gods.\" The use of god in singular\n  form, with a capital G, is indicative\n  of Christian influence.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition, using words like\n  \"doctrine\" and \"denial\" betray the\n  negativity seen of atheists by\n  theistic writers. Atheism does not\n  have a doctrine at all and atheists\n  certainly do not \"deny\" that gods\n  exist. Denial is the \"refusal to\n  believe.\" Atheism does not \"know there\n  is a god but refuse to believe in him\"\n  (or her). That would be like saying\n  that you know Big Foot exists but you\n  refuse to believe in him. If the\n  evidence of gods was insurmountable\n  and provable, and atheists still\n  refused to believe, then that would be\n  an act of denial.</p>\n  \n  <p>Speaking of the original meaning, the\n  word atheism comes from the Greek\n  atheos, which means \"without god.\" The\n  original meaning of the word, based on\n  its Greek origins, mentions nothing\n  about \"disbelief\" or \"denial.\" A short\n  and single-word definition would be\n  \"godless.\"\n  <a href=\"http://www.atheists.org/atheism/about_atheism\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it is <em>not</em> an international organization, but it seems that the definition the AA prefer is \"godless\". Also, it is interesting to note that they state older dictionaries only have the first two definitions, when the dictionaries that have been so far quoted in this thread have been as modern as a dictionary can be (i.e. obtained online).</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 404, "LastEditorUserId": 404, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-23T22:09:16.613", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-23T22:09:16.613", "CommentCount": 1}

Or\n  bureaucracy may oblige them to identify the placebo in written\n  notes to which the patient has access, which of course defeats the\n  object. Homoeopaths may be achieving relative success because\n  they, unlike orthodox practitioners, are still allowed to administer\n  placebos - under another name. They also have more time to\n  devote to talking and simply being kind to the patient. In the early\n  part of its long history, moreover, homoeopathy's reputation was\n  inadvertently enhanced by the fact that its remedies did nothing at\n  all - by contrast with orthodox medical practices, such as bloodletting,\n  which did active harm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": 27, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-25T07:48:57.763"}

When we make a conclusion, we can to some extent \"trace\" what this conclusion is based on, and how high our confidence level is about it. Reasoning is then the process of drawing new conclusions from existing ones, and evaluating one's confidence level about it.</p>\n\n<p>This process is not really like the mathematical logic in my opinion, because facts are <em>never</em> known with absolute certainty. It's always about probabilities. If you trace your conclusions all the way to their origin you will invariably find that your senses are the ultimate source. We usually place a very high degree of trust into them, taking what we perceive for a fact.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are good at drawing logically sensible conclusions and confidence levels in this imperfect-information \"game\", while others are really bad at it. At one extreme is not noticing fundamental flaws like circular reasoning, or massively mis-assigning confidence levels, or taking a conclusion as a 100% certain fact instead of evaluating it properly.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately though, even people who don't make such basic mistakes are still drawing conclusions with imperfect information, from \"probabilistic facts\" whose probability of being true they can only estimate very approximately. I don't think there's a <em>right</em> way to make these conclusions in the absense of an accurate probability measure.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I'm getting at is that this is a spectrum. We have propositions in our brains in which we have a certain degree of confidence. We casually classify them as knowledge or belief based on the degree of confidence we have in the reasoning chain that led to a particular proposition. If you reckon the reasoning chain is massively flawed, but a person has a high degree of confidence in the result, you casually call it \"belief\". If you think the chain is not too far off, you call it \"knowledge\". Postmodernist philosophers might still call it \"belief\" though.</p>\n\n<p>To conclude, I think I'll compare it with \"hot\" and \"cold\". The terms are convenient, even though there is no qualitative difference between them; the line between them is arbitrary and undefined, and they are relative to the context in which they are discussed. For example, sun's corona is <em>cold</em> compared to its core, but <em>hot</em> compared to snow - just like the existence of dark matter is a <em>belief</em> in comparison to the existence of gravity, but <em>knowledge</em> in comparison to the existence of god.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 89, "LastEditorUserId": 89, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-28T15:59:22.453", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-28T15:59:22.453", "CommentCount": 2}

I haven't read it so I can't speak to anything within, but I have heard, on average, fairly positive reviews.</p>\n\n<p>Still there is the question of whether our philosophies and creeds actually do anything to affect our behavior, which hasn't been super verified in research. For example, in the <a href=\"http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/darley_samarit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good Samaritan study</a> they had subjects who were training to be seminaries and normal people pass by someone who was in clear need of help(slumped in a corner of an alley way moaning). These participants behavior did not vary based on their seminarian status, but whether they were hurried or not made a huge impact on their stopping to help.<br>\nStill it is unclear what relationship moral beliefs has on moral behavior, one paper that explores an intermediate hypothesis and also nicely reviews the past research (as is available for free <a href=\"http://cognition.berkeley.edu/Publications_files/Lombrozo-CogSci-2009.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">online</a>) is Lombrozo's \"The role of moral commitments in moral judgment\".( 2009, <em>Cognitive Science</em>, 33, 273-286.)</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the degree to which answers to your question matter is dependent on the relationship that Lombrozo explores. If it turns out that these attitudes do not majorly affect behavior, it seems a pretty irrelevant question (to me at least) what atheists actually believe, but rather their behavior should be investigated on its own. Now I doubt that that strong hypothesis will end up being true especially given Haidt's work on <a href=\"http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/mft/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">foundations of morality</a> differing between political leanings. But still it'd be nice to see actual work on the relationship between atheist beliefs and moral behavior, which seems highly relevant to the underlying intent of your question.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 404, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-27T02:54:17.333", "CommentCount": 1}

Additionally, it de-legitimizes god-ordained social rules such as the belief that women are inferior to or must serve men, eliminates caste systems that divide people in social classes.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Theism</strong>: keeping in mind the great chain of being, beasts &lt; humans &lt; angels &lt; god. Among humans, atheists &lt; heathens &lt; gods chosen people. <br />\n<strong>Atheism</strong>: great chain of being can be dismissed as pseudoscience. Differences between humans and non-human animals are a matter of <em>degree</em>, rather than <em>kind</em>. <br />\n<strong>In practice</strong>: When we accept that some humans are not intrinsically better than others, it leads to a more egalitarian, humanistic ethic that includes all humans worldwide as equals within the moral community. Additionally, if we reject the belief in some insuperable chasm between human and non-human life, then it opens the door to an ethic that includes non-human animals as members of the moral community as well.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Theism</strong>: humans and their affairs at at the center of all moral concerns and conflicts. <br />\n<strong>Atheism</strong>: seems quite rational to approach moral conflicts from \"the point of view of the universe\", or a very egalitarian, non-human centric point of view. <br />\n<strong>In practice</strong>: seems to invite environmentalist considerations, where we have concern for how our actions affect the environment, even if those actions serve human interests.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Theism</strong>: humans have a god-given, intrinsic and absolute right to life. <br />\n<strong>Atheism</strong>: while atheism does not require a rejection of the sanctity of human life, rejecting religious grounding for it opens the door to philosophies where humans have an extrinsic/conditional right to life or a non-absolute right to life. <br />\n<strong>In practice</strong>: we have to think much harder about the answers to questions regarding the value of human life, particularly when quality of life conflicts with right to life. For example, whether abortion is acceptable in some cases, whether non-consentual euthanasia can be justified for people in persistent vegetative states or severely disabled infants, whether execution is a valid form punishment, whether we have obligations to people in distant countries equal to our obligations to people in our immediate vicinity, whether its fair for wealthy people to have preferential access to health care over poor people, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Theism</strong>: humans have an intrinsic and exclusive moral excellence which does not extend to non-human animals. <br />\n<strong>Atheism</strong>: makes it plausible to extend our notion of \"human excellence\" to non-human animals, or as an alternative reject human excellence and reduce the status of humans to non-human animals. <br />\n<strong>In practice</strong>: there's a good number of atheist philosophers like Peter Singer, Tom Regan, Gary Francione, Robert E Goodin, and others who connect the rejection of \"uniquely human excellence\" with development of the modern animal rights movement.</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": 318, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-27T05:27:30.870", "CommentCount": 1}

That might be why you weren't able to find a lot of information online on how to respond to this kind of argument.</p>\n\n<p>For those who are not familiar with the argument, TAG is an argument that tries to prove the existence of God by demonstrating that Christianity can account for logic but that naturalism can't. In other words, TAG tries to prove that Christianity a better explanation for how the universe behaves than naturalism can and thus that atheists should convert to Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>It's usually presented like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_identity\" rel=\"nofollow\">law of identity</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_non-contradiction\" rel=\"nofollow\">law of non-contradiction</a>, or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle\" rel=\"nofollow\">law of excluded middles</a>, exist.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes are absolutely true.</strong> They are not subjectively true; that is, they are not sometimes true and sometimes false, depending on preference or situation.  Otherwise, they would not be absolute. </li>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes form the basis of rational discourse.</strong> If the logical absolutes are not absolute, then truth cannot be known and no rational discourse can occur. </li>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes are transcendent.</strong> That is, they are not dependent on space, time, or human minds. They remain true, no matter where or when you are. They remain true, even if humans cease to exist or no matter what humans believe. </li>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes are not dependent on the material world.</strong> They are not found in atoms, motion, heat, or under rocks. Nor can they be be photographed, frozen, weighed, or measured. </li>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes are conceptual (of the mind) by nature.</strong> Logic is a process of the mind.  Logical absolutes provide the framework for logical thought processes.  Therefore, logical absolutes are conceptual by nature. </li>\n<li><strong>A person's thoughts reflect what he or she is. Absolutely perfect thoughts reflect an absolutely perfect mind.</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>Logical absolutes must then reflect a transcendent, absolute, perfect, and independent mind,</strong> as they are transcendent, absolute, are perfectly consistent, and are independent of the universe. </li>\n<li><strong>We call this transcendent, absolute, perfect, and independent mind God.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The above is the short version of Matt Slick's presentation of TAG, which is the version I have come across the most often. The full version can be read <a href=\"http://carm.org/transcendental-argument\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h1>Refuting TAG </h1>\n\n<p>There are many ways to refute TAG. Below are the counterarguments that I find the most persuasive. It's not an exhaustive list, by any means. </p>\n\n<h2>Point out that they're in deeper trouble</h2>\n\n<p>A common answer, by atheists, to TAG is that no one needs to account for the laws of logic. They are just this way, for no reason with no cause. It's just the way they are.</p>\n\n<p>Proponents of TAG will argue that \"Simply saying they exist is not an answer.\" However, adopting such a position is a dangerous one for a theist as this position has dramatic consequences for him.</p>\n\n<p>According to Christians, God has the attributes he has for no reason with no cause. If God's attributes were this way for a particular reason, it would imply the existence of another consciousness capable of modifying the attributes of God and that is not what they believe. Therefore, God's attributes are just this way, for no reason with no cause. It's just the way they are.</p>\n\n<p>It directly follows from that that logical absolutes are just this way, for no reason with no cause, because they are part of God's attributes. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the Christian ends up at the same place as the atheist in regards to logical absolutes - they just are the way they are - and he has to account for the existence of God on top of it. He'll likely try to argue he doesn't <em>have</em> to account for the existence of God, at which point you can tell don't have to account for the existence of logical absolutes if he doesn't account for the existence of God.</p>\n\n<h2>Correcting their understanding of logic</h2>\n\n<p>A poor understanding of logic is at the foundation of TAG. First of all, the phrase \"logical absolute\" is not used in academia. In fact, if you google it you'll notice that <em>all</em> the results are about TAG. That's because it's a phrase made up by apologists to help their rhetoric. </p>\n\n<p>The real term to described what they call a logical absolute is a law of logic.  </p>\n\n<p>Proponents of TAG believe, or try to persuade others that, laws of logic are prescriptive. That's false; they are descriptive. That is, the laws of logic don't tell the Universe how to behave but rather describe, to us, how the Universe behaves. In other words, the laws of logic are mere explanations of how certain aspects of the Universe behave and <em>that</em> is why you don't need to give an account for them: they exist only in our own minds, as we created them.</p>\n\n<h2>God is subject to the laws of logic</h2>\n\n<p>You can try to ask the theist if he believes that God can create a logically impossible object, like a square circle. If he does answer no, then you can point out that he too has to account for logical absolutes. </p>\n\n<p>A common counterargument to that argument is that God cannot behave in a way that is not consistent to his own nature. However, that is demonstrably false: if God created imperfect creatures (ie humans) even though He is perfect then He should be able to create a square circle.</p>\n\n<h2>Fallacy of Composition</h2>\n\n<p>The argument that \"A person's thoughts reflect what he or she is\" is fallacious. More precisely, it's a fallacy of composition. It is not because something is true of some part of the whole that it's necessarily true about the whole. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition#Example\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia's example</a> for this fallacy is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Atoms are not visible to the naked eye</li>\n  <li>Humans are made up of atoms</li>\n  <li>Therefore, humans are not visible to the naked eye.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By that logic, only a citrusy and liquid mind could conceive of orange juice. Needless to say, that's absurd. Humans minds can think of orange juice despite not being citrusy nor liquid. Likewise, human minds can conceive logical absolutes despite not being transcendent, absolute, or perfect.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 484, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-27T09:25:46.863"}

Full of smart atheists!\"</p>\n\n<p>And I say: \"How do you guarantee they will not nuke themselves within next 100 years?\"</p>\n\n<p>And you simply can't. You can't guarantee anything about a planet with 6 billion people and  natural laws that you don't fully understand. All you can do is to say, \"Well, we've had this religion for several thousand years, so maybe if we stick to it and are extremely conservative, it would work for several thousand more.\"</p>\n\n<p>So the smart thing to do would actually be - religion!</p>\n\n<p>Or admitting we really have no clue, religious or atheists, and simply do our best.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 420, "LastEditorUserId": 420, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-27T18:22:50.603", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-27T18:22:50.603", "CommentCount": 2}

That wasn't a punishment for the store manager stiffing someone on her overtime hours.</p>\n\n<p>Confirmation bias is also how people think they can predict the future, or read someone's thoughts: they only remember the hits (there was this one time that I just <i>knew</i> Aunt Martha was sick, and I called Aunt Fran and she said Aunt Martha was in the hospital!) and forget all the misses (all the other times Aunt Martha was sick and you had no idea until Aunt Fran called you to tell you).</p>\n\n<p>Now, if your bad behavior is that you were rude to the chimney cleaning guy, and as a result he damaged your chimney so that it leaked, then there IS a direct correlation. But that's not karma; that's a consequence of your behavior. </p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, I think that if you're a decent person, and you usually behave decently, the people around you will react to that and treat you decently, and vice/versa if you're a jerk. Also not karma, just common sense.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 71, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-28T16:19:22.290", "CommentCount": 7}

Karmas are attracted to the karmic\n  field of a soul on account of\n  vibrations created by activities of\n  mind, speech, and body as well as on\n  account of various mental\n  dispositions. Hence the karmas are the\n  subtle matter surrounding the\n  consciousness of a soul. When these\n  two components, i.e. consciousness and\n  karma, interact, we experience the\n  life we know at present.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you strip away the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and look at this as a psychological projection of the phrase you reap what you sow, it's is easy to understand the subtlety of Karma and how it does not need to rely on any god or supernatural concept in order to give one a sense of the world. </p>\n\n<p>Karma is not some cosmic piggy bank of good = good, when reduced to that it is a bastardization of it's millenias-old meaning. In this form, it is not an idea or worldview that can be gamed or exploited, as such it is not something that adds to how to understand the world. </p>\n\n<p>Karma in its truer-to-form framing, it is a shared understanding of the world, indigenous to the East, that is a projection of the reciprocity of one's actions. That's it. Reap what you sow. Basically, the choices you have in front of you are the outcome of the choices you have made in the past. There is no itemization to specific actions, but rather it must be construed as a gestault. </p>\n\n<p>Last, on a psychological <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma\" rel=\"nofollow\">view</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since the 20th century emergence of\n  emotional intelligence as a novel\n  paradigm for viewing human experience,\n  karma has become a sectarian term\n  which umbrellas the entire collection\n  (both conscious and subconscious) of\n  human emotionality.[41] This modern\n  view of karma, devoid of any spiritual\n  exigencies, obviates the need for an\n  acceptance of reincarnation in\n  Judeochristian societies and attempts\n  to portray karma as a universal\n  psychological phenomenon which behaves\n  predictably, like other physical\n  forces such as gravity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Note: If someone wants to add in reincarnation, they do make it a supernatural concept. So if you are an empiricist atheist, then it becomes contradictory. If you simply don't believe in god, you can still believe in anything else you want and still be an atheist, loosely speaking.)</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 135, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-28T17:24:46.293", "CommentCount": 2}

If he could not, he would have to buy 100 copies of my new book, <em>The Broken American Male</em>. A few days later Hitchens sent an email to the 92nd St. Y, who hosted the debate, citing Israeli writer Dr. Israel Shahak's book, <em>Jewish History, Jewish Religion</em>, as his source, and asking that his email be circulated to the debate's vast audience.</p>\n  \n  <p>I quickly wrote back that Shahak's 1965 claim to have witnessed an Orthodox man refusing to allow his telephone to be used to call an ambulance for a non-Jew because it would violate Shabbat, and to have had a \"rabbinical court in Jerusalem\" confirm that the man had acted properly, was exposed as a fraud a year later by Lord Immanuel Jakobovitz, later to become the universally venerated Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth. Jakobovitz wrote in <em>Tradition</em> in 1966: \"Dr. Shahak, challenged to substantiate his personal 'testimony' was eventually forced to admit that the Orthodox Jew he had 'witnessed' refusing the use of his telephone simply did not exist. The whole incident had been fabricated in true <em>Protocols</em> style. Equally overlooked was the circumstance that the Rabbinate, far from having confirmed Dr. Shahak's allegation, had in fact ruled that the Sabbath must be violated to save non-Jewish no less than Jewish lives.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>I asked Hitchens to now go back to the well and find a non-fraudulent source. And since his book cited \"many\" Jewish courts that had so ruled, surely it would be easy. I told him that I was happy to forgo the buying of 100 copies of my book in exchange for a simple correction of the defamatory error. To his great credit, Hitchens wrote back that it was \"very good of you to put it like that: I will certainly undertake to correct anything in my book that doesn't survive a challenge.... Shahak was a friend of mine and it's his honor that is posthumously at stake, not mine (or OK, as well as mine).\"</p>\n  \n  <p>After the exchange of several more emails, Hitchens wrote with a link to a column that in turn cited the controversial <em>New York Times</em> piece of July, 22, 2007, by my close friend Prof. Noah Feldman of Harvard, in which a Jewish teacher in his day school mentioned the existence of religious sources that would distinguish between a Jewish and non-Jewish life on the Sabbath. The column, however, conceded that these are minority opinions which are not authoritative and which have been overruled throughout Jewish history by Jewish courts who have never wavered from the ruling that Jews must save non-Jewish lives on all occasions and on the Sabbath. Based on this, and being unable to find a single court to back up his serious libel against Judaism, Hitchens wrote, \"I would consider changing religious courts to fundamentalist rabbinical authorities.\" And that's where it now stands, with Hitchens agreeing to do the honorable thing and amend the slur in his book, which I trust he will implement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": 484, "LastEditorUserId": 484, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-28T19:19:14.013", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-28T19:19:14.013", "CommentCount": 3}

This is not something anyone can prove; they simply are not permitted within a materialist's world view. This is undeniably and inherently vicious and circular: you're essentially claiming you don't believe non-material things can be known through a non-material method of knowing, because you would deny such method of knowing. This breaks down the topic into a few statements, which the burden will be on you to defend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Materialism is the only/most reasonable way of knowing. (as said, requires reason)</li>\n<li>It is not-rational to assume something exists without material evidence.</li>\n<li>That existence and non-existence is not 50/50. (requires reason)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>None of these should require much explanation. If you can convince someone that materialism is a better world view then God is excluded. Now we address the whooper:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What would make the statement, \"I know something does not exist\" true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'd argue that knowing something does not exist must be differentiated from, <em>\"I believe something does not exist\"</em>. And, in that you'll find the light at the end of the tunnel. Either,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"I know something does not exist\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>is invalid. Or, it is either the same as, or different from (tautological truth):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"I believe something does not exist\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For me, I want affirmative claims of non-existence to be useful and valid so I just tack on the addendum <strong>\"as far as I can presently <em>know</em> from the material evidence I have\"</strong>. I'll make the bold claim that this addendum is also implicit when this claim is made by any sane person -- including whomever I'm speaking to. Here is a useful quote stolen from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence\" rel=\"nofollow\">the wikipedia article about evidence and the absence thereof</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"In some circumstances it can be safely assumed that if a certain event had occurred, evidence of it could be discovered by qualified investigators. In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.\" - Introduction to Logic, Copi, 1953, Page 95</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wikipedia further goes on to use <em>I know there is no change in my pocket,</em> as a practical example of this non-violation of the \"evidence of absence\" fallacy. I could expand on this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"I believe that conscious aliens do not exist in our solar system.\"</em></li>\n<li><em>\"I know that conscious aliens do not exist in our solar system.\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would maintain the former has been exhausted... We can affirmatively state the later. As far a materialist can know or not know, we know conscious aliens do not exist in our solar system. The stance that the subject is not there is the only sane and rational one if you're a materialist with no further evidence, no evidence to the contrary, and no further experiments you could perform within reason.</p>\n\n<p>These are the same assumptions you would make to some claims in the affirmative:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I know evolution exists.</li>\n<li>I know gravity is a natural phenomena.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\"Know\" might be picking up a new meaning when you're affirming the negative, but it should be polysemously expanded to encompass that for materialists. Does this make it fair to state that a materialists truly <em>\"knows that something does not exist\"</em>? Yes, I think if you understand the worldview, and the axioms you're building on; and, you disregard that there is no telling defeat of utter skepticism.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 5, "LastEditorUserId": 5, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2010-12-29T18:30:37.643", "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-29T18:30:37.643", "CommentCount": 2}

If a guilty rapist and murderer was brought before a judge after having been found guilty, then asked the judge, \"Your honor, I know I'm guilty, but I know you are a good judge and so you'll let me off the hook.\" No, if that is a good judge, he'll put that guy away for life or give him the death sentence.

I just watched an episode of Nature where they confessed that scientist have no idea how certain Canadian area turtles are able to freeze completely and thaw without dying. </p>\n\n<p>So while a Christian can know a great deal of what God's will is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine John 7:17</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>God never said He'd explain every detail of life.

However, the problem isn't in the simple, it's in the effective. The mere fact that someone can say: \"God is good\" and expect it to mean something more than just those three words requires that \"God\" and \"good\" be independent concepts. But the logic of that may be too subtle.</p>\n\n<p>So, unfortunately, I don't yet have anything too much more concise than what I've written below. There are two main points that need to be accepted by the religious-believer in order for the argument to hold. Here I build up to the first point:</p>\n\n<p>If \"good\" is nothing more than \"whatever God is\" or \"whatever God says\", and God is not limited, then \"good\" can mean anything at all. That is, maybe, for the moment, \"good\" means X, but, of course, God can change that to Y in the next moment <em>for no reason other than whimsy</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if the religious were truly complacent with the idea that God is unlimited and therefore can determine what is \"good\" or isn't on a whim, then they would feel no need for there to be a \"reason\" (known or unknown) why God would command them to, for instance, rape ten women. They would not need to believe that \"God has a reason for doing this [that makes it good]\". It wouldn't matter. We would not feel the need to understand <em>why</em> something is \"good\" or \"evil\" or that there is, in fact, at least a reason in the mind of God. The moral status of an action would simply be so by decree or, as put another way, \"Might Makes Right\".</p>\n\n<p>If, instead, \"good\" has some other basis, something independent or, at the very least, indirectly-dependent of God, then the meaning of \"good\" is more restricted. There would be an actual <em>reason</em>, hidden or conspicuous, underlying the moral status of particular actions or intentions, not merely an arbitrary decree.</p>\n\n<p>If this model of morality is accepted (and I do believe it actually is by the majority of religious-believers), then regardless of what that reason is behind what is considered moral, it has been established that there is one as opposed to morality by arbitrary decree. This is the first point that I think should be accepted by the religious believer. If it can't be accepted, then you'll need to go in another direction or, in the case that this is actually true, accept that they believe \"might makes right\" -- and it is actually as simple as that for them. If another deity defeated or overruled theirs then they would follow that other deity's arbitrary moral decrees. Nothing else matters.</p>\n\n<p>Now on to the second point.</p>\n\n<p>If the first point can be accepted, then most of the work is already done. If there is a reason behind morality, then it is necessarily independent (or indirectly-dependent) of any deity; the deity must apply that reason to determine what is moral and what isn't. Surely a deity could have decided what that reason is, but an establishment of some measure of independence of morality from the deity itself is enough to further the argument. The argument can now become whether or not the deity provided the reason underlying the moral status of actions or whether that reason stands alone.</p>\n\n<p>To best drive home this second point you can speculate about what reasons could form the basis for morality. For instance, morality could be something that arose from the natural laws of our universe. For instance, because of how our universe behaves, suffering exists and an autonomous being has the ability to cause another to suffer. One might suggest that to intentionally cause suffering as an ends is morally wrong. Keep in mind this is just an example. But the point is that we can examine an action and the intentions behind it to determine <em>if</em> and <em>why</em> it should be considered immoral. Furthermore, if the natural laws of the universe changed somehow, changing the consequence but not the action, we may come to another conclusion. If stabbing a puppy actually made the puppy more healthy and happy -- we would have to reconsider how we morally label such an action.</p>\n\n<p>If this point can be accepted, then the argument is complete and only the conclusion needs to be stated. Namely, if they so wish, they can believe that a deity created the natural laws of the universe and, by doing so, this deity has indirectly set up the rules for morality. However, they must also now concede that, if natural laws can exist without a deity, then so can morality. More fully, morality can exist without any particular religious text or decree.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 335, "LastEditorUserId": 335, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-01-01T03:18:07.393", "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-01T03:18:07.393", "CommentCount": 2}

When we make a \"choice\", we select exactly one element from S.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose S has two elements: A and B. What is the process by which we decide whether to select A or B? I contend that the process is complex but can be described simply: We measure both A and B according to which we find the most desirable. If desire(X) is a function of how much we desire outcome X, then if desire(A) > desire(B), then we select A from S. That's it. The complexity of the desire() function is something for another discussion (perhaps).</p>\n\n<p>Now maybe this is something we feel is intuitively true, but I think actually writing it out is important, at least to me.

We will always \"choose\" the outcome that we perceive to be the most desirable.</li>\n<li>What we desire <em>determines</em> our choices.</li>\n<li>If we are capable of \"choosing\" what we desire, it is a <em>meta-operation</em>; some subset of our desires is not chosen.</li>\n<li>As an atheist I don't mind reasoning that my choices are merely a product of my desires (I always get to pick what I want! :P), but this is far more troublesome for those who believe they were created by an entity who cares what they choose -- and must have, in way or another, seeded them with desires that determined those choices.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So bringing this back into focus with regard to choosing what we believe. What do we really mean when we're asking: \"Can you choose what you believe?\" Are we asking the same question we would ask about any other kind of choice -- in which case, we need only look at what it actually means to \"choose\" -- or do we mean something different in this case?</p>\n\n<p>If it's the former, then <em>evidence</em> really has nothing to do with it -- at least directly.

I'm big on definitions, so I went and got one from dictionary.com (not the most irreproachable of authorities, but good enough to be getting on with):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the state or quality of being loyal; faithfulness to commitments or obligations. </li>\n<li>faithful adherence to a sovereign, government, leader, cause, etc. </li>\n<li>an example or instance of faithfulness, adherence, or the like: <em>a man with fierce loyalties</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think from this, we can extrapolate 3 different approaches to the stated question, and it yields slightly different answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Perceived/expressed value of loyalty</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>How important a <em>value</em> is loyalty in people's lives? Taking the first definition, of loyalty as the tendency to be consistent and faithful, we could say that the level of importance people place on this value <em>in the abstract</em> is how \"loyal\" they can be said to be. On this measure, based on what's gone before in the discussion and some of the links, I would say <strong>religious people and other conservatives probably outpace atheists and liberals in loyalty</strong>, inasmuch as they consider loyalty a more important value in their system of ethics.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Loyalty to groups vs. loyalty to individuals</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, the second definition brings in the collective aspect of loyalty, or the ingroup/outgroup view of it. If loyalty is to be defined as the extent to which one identifies with and tends to unconditionally approve of a larger organisation or structure, comprised of people and instantiate in the physical world and with an ingroup identity, e.g. a church, a country, a fan club etc., then the natural assumption to make is that those of a more conservative bent would be more inclined to this frame of mind. Again, this has been well covered above.</p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to loyalty individuals - the tendency to adhere to a specific person regardless of their group identity - the liberal mindset has an advantage over the conservative one, and by extension the atheist over the religious one.</p>\n\n<p>In a religious view, individuals inherit their right to the loyalty of their peers by continued identification with the group to which they all belong. Once the bonds of loyalty to the group are shaken, there is a knock on effect to the loyalty between the different members. I'm thinking of things like shunning, excommunication, ostracism etc., but also smaller fractures to the fabric of a community of loyalists when doubts or dissent enters the scene.</p>\n\n<p>It is much less likely - both in principle and from my personal experience, though I do not have statistics to support this hypothesis - that an atheist would, all other things being equal, cut off their family for becoming religious, than it is that a religious family cuts off a member who is gay, say. It is equally unlikely that an atheist terminate a friendship over church attendance (or other ideological differences not related to religion - veganism, say, or voting Conservative, or Ayn Rand).</p>\n\n<p>I think this \"loyalty gap\" is driven both by moral differences (Haidt is relevant here again - care and fairness towards a friend would tend to trump the fact that that friend behaves in a way an atheist or liberal finds unethical) and the attitude towards a multiplicity of views which is at the core of the liberal, and by extension usually atheist, mindset. </p>\n\n<p>On this view, <strong>atheists can be supposed to be the more loyal ones to the individuals in their lives</strong> - friends, family, members of the community. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Loyalty in word vs. loyalty in action</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When we come to look for actual instances of loyalty - as per the third definition above - the picture is somewhat complicated by the messyness of the real world. It's also extremely difficult to get concrete data on atheists as a group. But we do have a lot of anecdotal data on <em>religious</em> people, especially ones in the public eye: and it is certainly the case that, at least when it comes to sexual fidelity, things don't look too good for the religious. In the US in particular, but elsewhere as well, religious men in the public eye have an almost irresistible bent towards sexual transgression. The list is too long and well known to elaborate here, but one very topical example is the kippa-wearing former Israeli president Moshe Katsav, convicted of multiple sexual assaults this week - not very loyal to his wife or his state office!</p>\n\n<p>Liberals and conservatives are always hurling accusations of hypocrisy and dissimulation at each other. As a progressive, I'm naturally inclined to believe that cpnservatives are hypocritical liars whereas liberals just have a flexibility of mind that allows them to change course when they encounter new data. But this, I must acknowledge, might not be a scientifically objective conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>It is certainly the case that there are examples of loyalty to home and countny where religion is not concerned. Not all communist revolutionaries were brainwashed or coerced into loyalty to their party and political ideology; many Russian people fought in WWII with the greatest sincerity and from a deep conviction that a secular atheist worker state was worthy of their loyalty, even unto the ultimate sacrifice. Likewise the Maoist rebels still waging a low level civil war on the Indian government are not doing so from religious, but rather political conviction, and of course Che Guevara didn't die in Bolivia out of a lack of loyalty to his cause. So it would seem that religion is not a <em>necessary</em> component in patriotism or loyalty to a larger cause, even though it's been appropriated as such in much of the Western discourse.</p>\n\n<p>So maybe <strong>on this third aspect of the question, we must refer to the gods of \"more research is needed\"</strong>.  </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 126, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-31T14:07:08.887", "CommentCount": 2}

A six-year follow-up study of 3,968 older adults.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>METHODS:</strong> A probability sample of 3,968 community-dwelling adults aged 64-101 years residing in the Piedmont of North Carolina was surveyed in 1986 as part of the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) program of the National Institutes of Health. Attendance at religious services and a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables were assessed at baseline. Vital status of members was then determined prospectively over the next 6 years (1986 1992). Time (days) to death or censoring in days was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>RESULTS:</strong> During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,777 subjects (29.7%) died. Of the subjects who attended religious services once a week or more in 1986 (frequent attenders), 22.9% died compared to 37.4% of those attending services less than once a week (infrequent attenders). The relative hazard (RH) of dying for frequent attenders was 46% less than for infrequent attenders (RH: 0.54, 95% CI 0.48-.0.61), an effect that was strongest in women (RH 0.51, CI 0.434).59) but also present in men (RH 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75). When demographics, health conditions, social connections, and health practices were controlled, this effect remained significant for the entire sample (RH 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-.81), and for both women (RH 0.65, 95% CI 0.554-.76, p&lt;.0001) and men (RH 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.00, p=.05). </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Older adults, particularly women, who attend religious services at least once a week appear to have a survival advantage over those attending services less frequently. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it's safe to attribute the increased longevity to being socially active. When you have elderly persons, especially those living alone, it's expected that their lifespan would increase if they are out and about in the community. I believe similar studies show increased longevity for married persons, persons with close friends, and so on. </p>\n\n<p>In short, having friends and family around can, for a variety of reasons, help you live longer. Being old and alone is a bad combination. That the study participants were involved in religious services rather than, say, volunteering at the food bank, is (I imagine) inconsequential.</p>\n\n<p>Also, check out this pop-sci article about the study: <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/spirituality-may-help-people-live-longer?page=2&amp;print=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spirituality May Help People Live Longer</a>. In the article the study author (Dr. Koenig) pontificates on this correlation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Researchers, including Koenig, say there are limitations to the conclusions anyone should draw from these studies. It could be that people who attend religious services benefit from the social network they form. \"It might be that people in churches and synagogues watch out for others, especially the elderly,\" encouraging them, for example, to get help if they look sick, Koenig says.</p>\n  \n  <p>Also, it's known that among today's older men and women, religious belief often leads to less risky behavior, such as less alcohol consumption and smoking. And religious beliefs -- or a strong feeling of spirituality outside of traditional religions -- may improve an individual's ability to cope with the stresses of everyday life and the tribulations of aging, experts say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And later on in the article, this idea is reinforced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even people who don't describe themselves as religious probably can benefit from some of the lessons uncovered by research into spirituality and aging, says Harry R. Moody, Ph.D., a gerontologist and author of The Five Stages of the Soul.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"The message isn't 'Go back to church and you'll live a long time,' but stay connected with people on your own wavelength,\" says Moody, until recently the director of the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in New York City.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": 336, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-31T18:48:50.660", "CommentCount": 1}

Under what circumstances? My criterion as posted above still remains: based on truth. Based on reality. On what can be proven.</p>\n\n<p>Example: if John Doe is loyal to Group A, he identifies with Group A, he approves of Group A's actions and what Group A promotes, and he proclaims himself a member of Group A. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If Group A is a religion, then John\nis a theist, and his reason for\nloyalty may be that he believes Group\nA is the correct way to worship God. The leaders of Group A also command loyalty: you are supposed to listen to what they say and follow their instructions.</li>\n<li>If Group A is a political party, John\nmay be loyal to them because he\nagrees with their aims.</li>\n<li>If Group A is the business where he\nworks, John may be loyal because he\nwants to keep his job.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When would he break with Group A? </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If he finds a better job. If he gets\nfired. If he discovers that his\nbosses are committing or covering up\ncrimes.</li>\n<li>If the stated aims of the party\nchange. If the elected leaders do the\nopposite of what they said they would\ndo.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, if John is an atheist, he doesn't have to be loyal to a religion. And theists, who feel they must retain their allegiance to their group to be loyal to it, see this as <em>breaking</em> allegiance to their group. They see the atheist has NO allegiance to ANY theist group. They see the atheist refusing to follow instructions from ANY theist leader. And they perceive that as being \"disloyal.\" A Christian can understand how someone can be loyal to Judaism rather than Christianity, but not how someone can reject ANY loyalty to a deity whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>This is why atheists who used to be theists get so much grief. The former theist, who has realized that \"god\" can't be proven, is not just breaking allegiances with Group A, but with the entire structure of thought and purpose <em>behind</em> Group A. The atheist is rejecting the <em>reason</em> for Group A.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the framework behind the \"how can you be moral without God?\" problem. Theists are showing their loyalty to their group (religion) by following the group's instructions on \"how to be good.\" A theist may be confused, or appalled, at the idea that a person can determine for him-/herself what constitutes \"good\" rather than following the instructions already provided by the group, because that means one can be \"good\" and \"not loyal\" at the same time.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 71, "LastActivityDate": "2010-12-31T19:24:54.457"}

This is a pretty strong prediction considering that common sense tells us that this can\u2019t happen, and yet we can be absolutely sure that it will.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What kind of quantification can be done for biological evolution?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Too many to name. For further reading, look (for example) at the Wikipedia articles on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_genetics\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>quantitative genomics</strong></a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>evolutionary game theory</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Even more impressive is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>bioinformatics</strong></a> which in a way is <em>purely</em> quantitative. For example, sequence comparison uses similarity matrices to determine the probability of certain mutations (e.g. the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAM_matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">PAM matrix</a>) which are based off quantitative analysis of evolutionary changes in proteins.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the most powerful rebuttal to the argument that gravity is a more certain theory?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To anyone familiar with the subject, this is obvious. To others, not so much. The problem is that gravity, in a sense, is <em>familiar</em>: we experience it every minute of our life. Evolution is hard to grasp because it operates on extreme scales: the microscopic scale of protein machinery and the gigantic scale of evolutionary time, which is measured in eons. The human mind is not equipped to cope well with either scale (ironically, this is due to evolutionary adaptation of the brain).</p>\n\n<p>But how about this: <strong>if evolutionary theory were less certain than gravity, modern medicine wouldn\u2019t work</strong>. It fundamentally relies on the truth of evolution, and nothing would make sense without it. Consider something as simple as animal testing: the whole premise here is that animals are not only incidentally similar to us, but that they are similar <em>because</em> we have a common ancestor and that the machinery which we are testing the substances against works in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>So do paternity tests, AIDS tests, immunizations (flu shot), penicillin production, chemotherapy (cancer medication) and drug design. All of them need <em>reliable</em> predictions, which evolutionary theory provides.</p>\n\n<p>But for me, the most impressive prediction is this (adapted from Richard Dawkins): <strong>if we ever find life on another planet anywhere in the vastness of the Universe, we can be <em>certain</em> that its evolution obeys the same basic principles as here</strong>. They may not share the same information storage mechanism (e.g. DNA) but there will be <em>some</em> storage, there will be (lossy) copying from one generation to the other, there will be some kind of interpreter of the information and there will be an interplay between environment and \u201cgenome\u201d \u2013 in summary, there will be mutation and selection. We know this just as certain as we know that that planet will obey the laws of gravity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it wrong to say that the theory of evolution can only ever make qualitative predictions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess that one is answered, then.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it dangerous to concede the point that biology can not yet live up to the level of quantification of physics, and it never will, thus affirming it is less certain?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just dangerous, it\u2019s wrong.

It doesn't work, and you give them a nice negative example, the way annoying evangelical southern baptists give <em>us</em> a nice negative example. But there are very few good positive examples to counterbalance it, so it just makes the rest of us look like dicks. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 169, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-04T17:06:20.270", "CommentCount": 4}

U. S. (1982)</a> (Oyez abstract). The concurrence is that <strong>discrimination is one exercise of free speech / religion that may be burdened by the state.</strong> In other more practical words, your anti-theism can be restricted if it crosses over into prohibitory hiring or servicing practices, and likely if you show a marked favortism for anti-theists. In your case you are not likely tax-exempt as an anti-theist foundation, however I believe a case like this would bear civil impact and the person who brings suit would have a claim to relief.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Facts of the Case: \n  Bob Jones University was dedicated to \"fundamentalist Christian beliefs\" which included prohibitions against interracial dating and marriage. Such behavior would lead to expulsion. In 1970, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) changed its formal policy to adopt a district court decision that prohibited the IRS from giving tax-exempt status to private schools engaging in racial discrimination. The IRS believed that the University's policies amounted to racism and revoked its tax-exempt status. The University claimed that the IRS had abridged its religious liberty. This case was decided together with Goldsboro Christian Schools Inc. v. United States, in which Goldsboro maintained a racially discriminatory admissions policy based upon its interpretation of the Bible, accepting for the most part only Caucasian students. The IRS determined that Goldsboro was not an exempt organization and hence was required to pay federal social security and unemployment taxes. After paying a portion of such taxes for certain years, Goldsboro filed a refund suit claiming that the denial of its tax-exempt status violated the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n  \n  <p>Question: \n  Can the government prohibit race discrimination at the expense of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clauses?</p>\n  \n  <p>Conclusion: \n  The Court found that the IRS was correct in its decision to revoke the tax- exempt status of Bob Jones University and the Goldsboro Christian School. These institutions did not meet the requirement by providing \"beneficial and stabilizing influences in community life\" to be supported by taxpayers with a special tax status. The schools could not meet this requirement due to their discriminatory policies. The Court declared that racial discrimination in education violated a \"fundamental national public policy.\" The government may justify a limitation on religious liberties by showing it is necessary to accomplish an \"overriding governmental interest.\" Prohibiting racial discrimination was such a governmental interest. Hence, the Court found that \"not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, you might be interested in some boilerplate legalese regarding non-discrimination:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The [entity] shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, or national origin.

Jeremy Gunn that goes into depth trying to analyze the problems with current attempts at definitions of religion. The purpose was to create a framework for adjudicators of asylum seekers that are seeking asylum on the grounds of religious persecution</a>.(All quotes below belong to this article, pp. 189-215)</p>\n\n<p>His purpose is to emphasize that not all three conditions should be required of the petitioner, and the adjudicator should assess the three following features of a religion when trying to understand whether or how someone has/n't been persecuted:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"religion in its metaphysical or theological sense (e.g., the underlying truth of the existence of God, the dharma, etc.)\"; \"Religion as belief\"</li>\n<li>\"religion as it is psychologically experienced by people (e.g., the feelings of\nthe religious believer about divinity or ultimate concerns, the holy, etc.)\"; \"Religion as identity\"</li>\n<li>\"religion as a cultural or social force (e.g., symbolism that binds a\ncommunity together or separates it from other communities)\"; \"Religion as a way of life\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Mr Gunn then moves on to explain the two different approaches to defining a religion, the essentialist (where one picks a single trait shared among all, ie. \"All Religions believe in a g/God\", and the \"polythetic\" where the religions are not bound by a singular, essential trait but by shared familial traits. To explain the latter, he references a 1965 US Supreme Court quote: \"[T]he test of belief \u201cin a relation to a Supreme Being\u201d [in a law providing for conscientious objector status from military service] is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God.\"</p>\n\n<p>As religious and political persecution are means for an Asylum-seeker's application to be granted, it seems incumbent upon the atheist community to have a presence in these proceedings that isn't strictly limited to political persecution. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As a note: <a href=\"http://www.rapidimmigration.com/1_eng_kit_asylum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">(the determination of) political asylum (is) based on an actual experience of persecution in your home country or fear of persecution based on race, religion, or political opinion</a>. The requirements not only of actual or precedence of persecution make it very difficult to have atheism, when not viewed as a religious category, be grounds for political asylum. </li>\n<li>Political persecution is hard to prove without extreme examples of religious police</li>\n<li>Violence of one group of [Religion A members] against atheists does not constitute political or religious persecution, just as Drug Cartels' violence is not indicative of systematic persecution of the people it harms. (It means there is an enforcement problem, and the religious aspect is classified as happenstance.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to strengthen the case for atheists that fear/experience persecution, and that cannot describe atheism as a religion (or religious category), how can we construct a logical case for religious persecution of atheism? To streamline, here is a format for answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Please post a illustrative example</strong> (hypothetical or actual) where atheism is not used as a religion, yet functionally allows for status as religious persecution of the asylum applicant's atheistic views (not as political persecution)? (<em>Your Example</em>)</li>\n<li>If atheism should not be defined in relation to religion (as seems to be a widely held view on the site), how can it be practically defined in relation to religious persecution? (<em>Your Functional Definition</em>)</li>\n<li>Political persecution overrides religious in some cases (i.e. Shari'a law, \"neutral\" laws (p. 213) based on religious norms, etc) but is harder to prove, also in cases (also, where the predominant cultural group is religiously oppressive; Mutawwa'in example on pg. 211); however, answers should have a recourse for atheist seekers of asylum, so on what basis can one form a claim of persecution if one's \"religion\" isn't really a religion?

I was on the role as a United Methodist in a sanctioned church, but that church did not require that I recite the Nicene or Apostle's creed to become a member. They made up their own initiation that spoke of being a \"sojourner\", a seeker of wisdom. Jesus Christ may have been the primary provider of the wisdom that was preached on Sundays, but his name wasn't mentioned all that much. We read Crossan and Borg and publicly went against the authority of the church and welcomed gays. </p>\n\n<p>It all seemed logical to me. The stories from the Bible have good lessons, and I wanted to be around people who did good things, and they happened to be hanging out at a church. The people were acting consistently, that is practicing what they preached, so no logical problems there. </p>\n\n<p>There were limits, such as the person who decided to follow Islam. He would still show up sometimes, but he is no longer a member. Another person who attends often is a Jew. He offers stories and lessons from his tradition, but does not want to \"convert\". There were many others such as myself that would never have gone to any other to church. </p>\n\n<p>There are many other examples. If you define religion as a psychological or social force, you have already eliminated the supernatural force. I have experienced the power of a community that lovingly supports its members without a need to draw on prepared prayers spoken in unison or invocations of the names of saints or prophets so the question proposes no problems for me. I got the benefit of a religious-like community without the woo-woo.</p>\n\n<p>I quit the church because an entity that large changes too slow and large parts of it are engaged in activities such anti-gay or pro-military that I don't think are logically consistent with the teachings that it claims to base its platform on. The only reason I could see that it would be logically incoherent to be a religious adherent is that the religions themselves are not logically coherent. But one could be created that is. </p>\n\n<p>Jesus was advocating that his religion needed to change, and Paul stated that people could now base their laws on love, not the 400 and however many rules in Deuteronomy. So, 2,000 years later, it is not that far fetched that we can say God doesn't exist. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.walkerchurch.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is the website of the church, just so you can see I am not making it up</a></p>\n\n<p>\nTo add a finer point on this, the UMC is very aware of the philosophy of this church, so there is some sort of internal logical consistency that allows for churches like this, who are challenging the establishment, to exist within that establishment. This is as logical as having a communist party openly running for office in the United States. Change, in the UMC, comes from within, by design, with regular voting that starts by congregations selecting delegates and bubbling up to the international conference. For that to have any value, there has to be an allowance for non-conformity. </p>\n\n<p>I could see why if you view religion as a rigid set of beliefs with change only coming from a small group at the top, then this question would seem logically difficult. But if you allow for religions that include many viewpoints and open discussion, and many of them do, then out of the millions of people going to church, you have to accept that eventually someone is going to stand up and say, \"hey, wait a minute, God is not consistently portrayed in this book we read every week. And what difference does it make if we believe in a virgin or not? I like what we are doing here, but does it really require that we believe these things?\" And eventually a discussion group would form, then a committee, etc. </p>\n\n<p>This has been going on for decades. Most people just leave, or just keep quiet when they have these thoughts, but a few have stayed and we have movements like The Emergent Church and people like Brian McClaren and John Shelby Spong.

An interesting counter-example is Buddhism, and particularly, Zen-Buddhism.  A good deal of the Buddha's original teaching was <strong>not</strong> a religion, but a response, even a criticism, to an existing religion (Hinduism).  It appears mythical nowadays, because it was written in a religious context - Not too many atheists lived in 500 B.C India! However, basic Buddhism does not enforce a believe in a deity (although it was commonly mixed with existing religions, such as Tibetan Bon or Chinese Daoism).  It also <strong>denied</strong> the existence of a pre-defined destiny (Karma).  The Buddha himself never claimed to be a deity, and made it perfectly clear that he will <strong>not</strong> return after his death.  Zen-Buddhism took this state-of-mind to extreme, and Zen monks use to laugh and taunt at ceremonial religious activities.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize: Most religions in the world do focus on worshiping deities, and therefore denying the existing of a God makes the person a \"social believer\" rather than a follower.

One is that of substance, the other is the dualism of these substances. A substance is characterized by its properties, but, according to those who believe in substances, it is more than the collection of the properties it possesses, it is the thing which possesses them. So the mind is not just a collection of thoughts, but is that which thinks, an immaterial substance over and above its immaterial states. Properties are the properties of objects. If one is a property dualist, one may wonder what kinds of objects possess the irreducible or immaterial properties in which one believes... Now one might try to think of these subjects as just bundles of the immaterial states. This is Hume's view. But if one thinks that the owner of these states is something quite over and above the states themselves, and is immaterial, as they are, one will be a substance dualist. (<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#SubDua\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that someone would, from the perspective of a materialist, contrive or conjure up such a system is evidence of the person trying to interpret the world around them. It is not a defect of their reasoning, instead it is typically argued that there is a cognitive dissonance in the concept of materialist claims to knowledge, principally that they have no intuitive understanding of qualitative knowledge. Here is an example from the SEP:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I]magine a future scientist who has lacked a certain sensory modality from birth, but who has acquired a perfect scientific understanding of how this modality operates in others. This scientist \u2014 call him Harpo \u2014 may have been born stone deaf, but become the world's greatest expert on the machinery of hearing: he knows everything that there is to know within the range of the physical and behavioural sciences about hearing. Suppose that Harpo, thanks to developments in neurosurgery, has an operation which finally enables him to hear. It is suggested that he will then learn something he did not know before, which can be expressed as what it is like to hear, or the qualitative or phenomenal nature of sound. These qualitative features of experience are generally referred to as qualia. If Harpo learns something new, he did not know everything before. He knew all the physical facts before. So what he learns on coming to hear \u2014 the facts about the nature of experience or the nature of qualia \u2014 are non-physical. This establishes at least a state or property dualism. (See Jackson (1982); Robinson (1982)) (<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#ArgForDua\" rel=\"nofollow\">cit. SEP</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Frequently, people who cannot commit to the ontological leap of materialism are often hung up on the <em>qualia</em> mentioned above. A materialist rebuttal is often, \"there's an up until now uncalculated variable for that.\" The dualist riposte is \"intuitively speaking, the idea of being able to know all things a priori, as a matter of variables, without experiencing them sounds far fetched.\"</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 135, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-12T21:51:59.113"}

You can't understand something if you don't listen to it and read up on it. You have an advantage because there are many that have already done the work and left you with good starting points, so you can begin your study with a fair amount of certainty that you are confirming what you already know. </p>\n\n<p>For example, you no doubt believe Revelations is allegory, not an actual prediction of the end times that can be deciphered. Take a few minutes and read it and you can confirm that. Trouble is, someone comes along and says that you need to understand the symbolism, or you need to read everything Calvin wrote, and you're wondering how you get around that. You are fairly certain that no matter how many of the symbols you can trace or how many interpretations you read, you are not going to be able to demonstrate the inconsistencies and prove that Revelations is not whatever this idealist says it is. And your right. That's how theology works. You would prove it to yourself, but you knew it with just a cursory look. Theology relies on people accepting something is true without evidence. </p>\n\n<p>As Daniel Dennett puts it \u201cTheology is a way of not coming clean about the whole enterprise.\u201d\nIt relies on making propositions that seem to be profound, but only because it is actually logically ill-formed. These propositions have 2 readings:\n        On one, it is true but trivial\n        On the other, it is false, but would be earth-shattering if it were true\nAn example would be \"love is just a word\". True, it is a word, and if that's all it was, that would be earth shattering. But love is much more than that and we get to live in the world where it is hard to define and we have to struggle with that. But a theologian tries to get around questions of god's existence and says things like, \"god is no being at all\" and goes on selling books while you try to work out through the logic of that. </p>\n\n<p>The good news is, in most cases, there is an easy way out. Just ask the person if they have read Revelations, or whatever they are using as evidence for how their thinking is valid. Most won't have, they are just repeating what someone else said, and you ask who that is. If they have read it, ask for more specifics. They will be vague. If they are specific, you will note the inconsistencies in their line of reasoning, and if you ask for clarification, they will either interrupt you or get the point that you aren't going to accept their reasoning. </p>\n\n<p>So, that's how I handle trying to understand the thinking of people who are right in front of me. To understand how so many human beings came to think this way, you will have to study. If you figure it out, let us know. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 584, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-13T18:36:02.363"}

Theists almost always believe that their religious beliefs best explain something about the Universe. Perhaps it's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument\" rel=\"nofollow\">why something exists</a> rather than nothing, or the level of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument\" rel=\"nofollow\">complexity in the Universe</a>, or the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_morality\" rel=\"nofollow\">origin of morality</a> but, whatever it is, a theist will feel that his or her religious belief best explains what they know of the Universe.</p>\n\n<p>Atheists will disagree over the validity of that explanation and <em>that</em> is where the real disagreement is. Atheists feel that gods do not meet <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11046\" rel=\"nofollow\">the criteria for a good explanation</a>: <b></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Testability:</b> Better explanations render specific predictions that can be falsified or corroborated.<b></li>\n  <li>Scope (aka \u201ccomprehensiveness\u201d):</b> Better explanations explain more types of phenomena.<b></li>\n  <li>Precision:</b> Better explanations explain phenomena with greater precision.<b></li>\n  <li>Simplicity:</b> Better explanations make use of fewer claims, especially fewer as yet unsupported claims (\u201clack of ad-hoc-ness\u201d).<b></li>\n  <li>Mechanism:</b> Better explanations provide more information about underlying mechanisms.<b></li>\n  <li>Unification:</b> Better explanations unify apparently disparate phenomena (also sometimes called \u201cconsilience\u201d).<b></li>\n  <li>Predictive novelty:</b> Better explanations don\u2019t just \u201cretrodict\u201d what we already know, but predict things we observe only after they are predicted.<b></li>\n  <li>Analogy (aka \u201cfit with background knowledge\u201d): </b>Better explanations generally fit with what we already know with some certainty.<b></li>\n  <li>Past explanatory success:</b> Better explanations fit within a tradition or trend with past explanatory success (e.g. astronomy, not astrology).</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To atheists, a god is a complex, untestable hypothesis that violate many of the laws we know govern the physical world and offer no predictions. As such, it is a bad explanation and thus is abandoned. </p>\n\n<p>That is the core difference between the two world views: different views of what makes a valid explanation for the unknown. A theist's views will be coherent <em>if</em> you grant their standard of what qualifies as a good explanation. Everything else in their worldview is decided according to that one single assumption. It's because you do not grant them or realize the presence of that first assumption that their views seem illogical or incomprehensible.  </p>\n\n<p>Note that, while I used atheist and theist here, the terms can be easily replaced by materialist and dualist.

But it is our willingness to let go of a belief when evidence to the contrary is presented that is the most important indicator of \"faith\" as opposed to simple \"belief\". </p>\n\n<p>I make the bold claim that Faith is belief in the face of contrary evidence for that reason. Faith appears when the holder of a belief resists the necessary rejection of a belief. In most cases, when we believe something with insufficient evidence, we have no issue with dropping the belief when proven wrong. An example: I might think that my cat is behind the couch. I don't have any direct evidence of this, just a sense that since this has often happened before, it's likely to be the case this time as well. But if I go and look behind the couch, and my cat is not there, I will drop my belief that my cat was there without much thought. That is belief. Most scientific ideas fall into that category: we have no real personal stake in whether the idea is true or not, even if we could possibly find it attractive that it be so or not so.</p>\n\n<p>We enter the realm of Faith when a belief is dear enough to us to affect our identity. Most people speak of Faith as very much a defining characteristic of their being. When a belief we hold dear enough to define ourselves by it, in whole or in part, is challenged by evidence (or by the strong argumentation of another), our natural tendency is to adopt a defensive attitude, and to raise a wall of protection around that belief. Since letting go of that belief would require us to review how we see ourselves, and since that is not usually considered a pleasant experience by most adults, we will likely show a varying degree of resistance to the new information. The level of resistance offered is not usually linked to the strength of the evidence provided, but rather to the degree to which one identifies oneself with that belief. It is then that very resistance which defines Faith as different from Belief.</p>\n\n<p>All humans believe in some things without sufficient evidence. We could never function without that ability. We are pattern-detection engines, and we often will detect patterns when there is scant evidence available. So belief is not at issue here. </p>\n\n<p>But most scientifically minded people are wary of Faith; the resistance to evidence inherent in Faith is antithetical to the scientific method and mindset. That does not mean that we don't fall into the trap at times.

For example, some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process\" rel=\"nofollow\">finely tuned coincidence</a> allows carbon atoms to form in abundant quantities.

If a multitude of universes were created, each with its own constants set, then it would be fairly unsurprising that we live in one with a set such as to support intelligent life. However, postulating multiple universes is not really an accepted theory at the moment as obviously experimental proof is necessary, and we have no idea yet on how to find it.</p>\n\n<p>So in other words, use the anthropic principle lightly - certainly more lightly than Dawkins does in The God Delusion. Things are very grey in that area scientifically. It's mostly philosophy for now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What would the consequences be, if we could prove that the constants are effectively fine-tuned?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all, it would not prove anything regarding an intelligent designer of the universe. For example, what would <em>his/her</em> constants look like? The argument is no different from having discovered that we had a big bang - it doesn't imply a creator at all.</p>\n\n<p>What it actually implies, is that there has to be a mechanism by which the constants are tuned to the values they have. In other words, it would become an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics\" rel=\"nofollow\">open problem of physics</a>, just like many others.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 675, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-19T14:12:19.067"}

Can we allow any/every sect to demand the right to erect worship structures throughout \"public\" space, and then demand that the public HAS to fund them for ALL religions that wish to do so?  Like <a href=\"http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2011/01/eruv-dispute-in-hamptons-goes-to-court.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a>, or <a href=\"http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2011/01/suit-challenges-countys-refusal-to.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a>, or <a href=\"http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2011/01/legislation-introduced-to-permit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a>,\nAccommodating ALL faith requests is impractical, so tending toward a neutral, non-accommodation of all public (i.e. civil/governmental) religious accommodations seems better and more universally fair.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 2,</strong> embedded is, these things must be negotiated within society.  Any sect making unilateral claims to ultimate authority, superceding societal arbitration and law, cannot be accommodated.  Generally, assertions of \"faith before law\" cannot be accommodated in a society that purports to be secular, tolerant, diverse.  <a href=\"http://www.austindacey.com/books.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Austin Dacey's excellent book \"The Secular Conscience\"</a> covers this concept in detail.  Belief, faith, morality DO belong in the negotiations, but if you play the religion trump card to try to excuse yourself from participating in societal rule making, you can't be accommodated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 3.</strong>  Claims upon my right to free speech are off the table.  Allowing ideas to enter and mingle at the table of society's negotiations, is how we can sift and winnow the crap ideas from the brilliant.  When a sect demands the right to unilaterally define what is or is not offensive to it, and then backs it up through extra-legal enforcement measures, I cannot accommodate.  This does not mean I advocate incivility, but that no person engaged in conversation may play the \"offense\" or \"blasphemy\" trump card... it is too large a claim placed upon the individual AND upon the society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 4:</strong> Finally, on the front addressed <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-10-11-column11_ST_N.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">so thoroughly by Gerry Coyne</a>, I cannot accommodate... when the claim is inserted into the public sphere, not just some random wingnut's anecdotal claims... I cannot accommodate the concept that there are \"different ways of knowing.\"  Again, this does NOT infringe on the reality that some people just \"get\" things, or appreciate things differently than I.  It just means that when we talk about these things publicly, the \"common\" understanding has to be scientific, replicable and accessible to the individual through effort (if he/she so desires) rather than accessible through \"faith\" and or obeisance to the authorities of a given sect.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 149, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-19T15:55:14.930", "CommentCount": 1}

And, at the most basic of levels, it ties in with the university's official \"recognition\" of the group.  As a state institution, there are serious constitutional questions surrounding the recognition of a blatantly christian organization, as the state is officially not supposed to appear to be supporting one religion over another.  </p>\n\n<p>I would begin by publicly asking why this group is even seeking university recognition in the first place.  What benefits does recognition confer upon the group?  A post office box?  The group is free to meet on-campus following any other protocols for finding meeting places as any other group, officially sanctioned or otherwise.  This might be sufficient to call out the real reasons why they're seeking recognition.  The university won't take a position about any groups of students who meet to do something for any reason as long as it's not outwardly illegal (so the OSU Drug Running, Prostitution, and Money Laundering Student Group wouldn't be able to continue with its activities no matter what).  Recognition does not really give that much more of a benefit, so it's not a question of the free speech to which they're entitled.</p>\n\n<p>If they insist upon seeking recognition, then a reasonable response would be to create a new student group ostensibly based upon a religion that this other group would consider antithetical to their own views.  Satanism actually serves this purpose quite nicely.  If the Satanist group is rejected in its petition for recognition, you have a legitimate grievance against the university in that it permitted one religious group but not yours.  If it is approved in its petition for recognition, stick to the group's charter but allow its actions to follow the movements of the Christian group.  </p>\n\n<p>The simple truth of the matter is that freedom of religion applies to all religions or none at all.  Ditto for free speech.  If someone wants to proclaim their faith loudly and publicly, that's certainly their prerogative, but that just sets the stage for others of opposite views to do the same thing.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 205, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-19T19:01:48.413", "CommentCount": 2}

A finely tuned theory only works for a very small region of parameter space, suggesting that the theory itself might be \"overly engineered\" to make it work.  Basically, when trying to come up with a theory, it is easy to jury rig some ideas together that would produce unrealistic behavior, but that this behavior is hidden by fine cancellations or making some effects minuscule by hand (as opposed to a consequence from some principle). It's basically a way to guess at the likelihood of a theory being accurate, when many theories make equally accurate predictions of nature.</p>\n\n<p>An example might clear things up.  There is a problem in particle physics called the \"Hierarchy Problem,\" where the mass of Higgs Boson would be far too large without lots of fine tuning <em>in the Standard Model</em>.  Other theories, such as low energy supersymmetry don't require this fine tuning, and so are said to \"solve the Hierarchy Problem\". This is a major reason why physicists are studying supersymmetry, even though there are no experimental results to date that mandate it. </p>\n\n<p>When people say the Universe is fine tuned for life, they really mean that the Standard Model and General Relativity are fine tuned for life.  The fine tuning may disappear or be reduced in a more accurate theory.  Perhaps there is even a zero parameter theory, which couldn't have any fine tuning at all.  </p>\n\n<p>In short, the fine tuning argument really says that our best explanations, <em>to date</em>, don't explain some coincidences.

Random changes then created a depression in the light-sensitive patch, a deepening pit that made \"vision\" a little sharper. At the same time, the pit's opening gradually narrowed, so light entered through a small aperture, like a pinhole camera.</p>\n  \n  <p>Every change had to confer a survival advantage, no matter how slight. Eventually, the light-sensitive spot evolved into a retina, the layer of cells and pigment at the back of the human eye. Over time a lens formed at the front of the eye. It could have arisen as a double-layered transparent tissue containing increasing amounts of liquid that gave it the convex curvature of the human eye.</p>\n  \n  <p>In fact, eyes corresponding to every stage in this sequence have been found in existing living species. The existence of this range of less complex light-sensitive structures supports scientists' hypotheses about how complex eyes like ours could evolve. The first animals with anything resembling an eye lived about 550 million years ago. And, according to one scientist's calculations, only 364,000 years would have been needed for a camera-like eye to evolve from a light-sensitive patch. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What's important to understand about the process is that it is gradual across many generations, and very, very many dead ends that don't produce a competitive advantage for the evolving organisms.</p>\n\n<p>Other good links are referenced off of wikipedia. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye</a></p>\n\n<p>Have you heard the term \"The invisible hand of the market\" to describe capitalism?

However, it's not the intangible and dubious idea of a creator, it's the very real and very visible competition among animals and plants to survive.  If a mutation occurs, it is <em>very</em> likely to be a bad mutation leading to the death of the organism or to its inability to procreate or compete for resources as well as another, non-mutated member of the same species.  However, from time to time slight genetic variation gives rise to a mutation that confers some small advantage to competition and survival.  That organism is far more likely to survive, prosper, and thus pass along those genes.  Over time that trait can become dominant.

The actual statement of the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism is a relatively mild one that expresses skepticism about the absoluteness of 'Darwinism' (and is in line with the falsifiability required of scientific theories) to explain all features of life, and does not in any way represent an absolute denial or rejection of evolution. By contrast, a tongue-in-cheek response known as Project Steve, a list of scientists named Steve who agree that evolution is \"a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences,\" has 1080 Steves as of March 26, 2009.

The Science Resources Statistics Division of the National Science Foundation estimated that in 1999, there were 955,300 biological scientists in the US (about 1/3 of who hold graduate degrees).

In addition, a large fraction of the Darwin Dissenters have specialties unrelated to research on evolution; of the dissenters, three-quarters are not biologists. Therefore, the roughly 150 biologist Darwin Dissenters represent about 0.0157% of the US biologists that existed in 1999. As of 2006, the list was expanded to include non-US scientists, overestimating the number of US scientists that do not accept evolution according to the Discovery Institute, a known creationist lobby institution.

Newberg, neurological processes which are driven by the repetitive, rhythmic stimulation which is typical of human ritual, and which contribute to the delivery of transcendental feelings of connection to a universal unity. They posit, however, that physical stimulation alone is not sufficient to generate transcendental unitive experiences. For this to occur they say there must be a blending of the rhythmic stimulation with ideas. Once this occurs \"\u2026ritual turns a meaningful idea into a visceral experience.\" Moreover they say that humans are compelled to act out myths by the biological operations of the brain due to what they call the \"inbuilt tendency of the brain to turn thoughts into actions\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Studies of the brain and religious experience</p>\n  \n  <p>Early studies in the 1950s and 1960s attempted to use EEGs to study brain wave patterns correlated with \"spiritual\" states. During the 1980s Dr. Michael Persinger stimulated the temporal lobes of human subjects with a weak magnetic field. His subjects claimed to have a sensation of \"an ethereal presence in the room.\". Some current studies use neuroimaging to localize brain regions active, or differentially active, during religious experiences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And here's a partial list of experiences that tend to produce 'religious' or 'spiritual' states of being:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meditation</p>\n  \n  <p>Praying</p>\n  \n  <p>Music</p>\n  \n  <p>Dance, such as: Sufi whirling</p>\n  \n  <p>Extended exercise, often running in a large communal circle, which is used in various tribal and neo-pagan religions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Extreme pain, such as:</p>\n  \n  <p>Mortification of the flesh</p>\n  \n  <p>Profound sexual activity,</p>\n  \n  <p>Use of Entheogens, such as: Ayahuasca (Dimethyltryptamine) Salvia divinorum (Salvinorin A) Peyote (Mescaline) Psilocybe cubensis (Psilocybin) Amanita muscaria (Muscimol)</p>\n  \n  <p>Psychological or neurophysiological anomalies, such as:</p>\n  \n  <p>Profound depression or schizophrenia, Temporal lobe epilepsy, Stroke\n  Near-death experience, Learning</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The thing that all these have in common is that they strongly affect the brain.

Now extend that to someone who might have been indoctrinated into the existence and idea if god since before they learned to walk.  That's an amazingly difficult bias to overcome.

Religious people are taught and lean toward unquestioning adherence to authority, especially scriptural.</p>\n\n<p>Liberal thinking is based on liberal interpretations, first of the religious texts, and then of the world itself.  Allowing yourself to question the status quo is not a conservative strength, it is a liberal strength.</p>\n\n<p>You can take the example of bathing.  For a couple of hundred years during the late middle ages and early renaissance, bathing routinely was regarded with great suspicion, and was thought to lead to ungodly fascination with the body and vice.  Since people who bathed regularly tended to outlive those that didn't, and because of emerging knowledge of hygiene, this mode of thinking died out.  Now, people believe that 'cleanliness is next to godliness' - Why?  Not because of any deep thinking about it, but because it's an inherited conservative opinion.  When the 'hippies' came around and said that bathing every day and slathering yourself in deodorant is stifling, it was the conservatives that resisted them.</p>\n\n<p>Religious people are taught in a thousand different ways, from subtle to overt to not question authority, especially their holy books.  So, whatever the entrenched authority says no matter how ridiculous, the conservatives will hew to it.  This is why liberalism is always a minority opinion in the religious communities.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 524, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-30T09:44:41.743"}

In fact, ignostics do not believe that [god] exists, but take this a step further. So for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An atheist would bring up Russell's cosmic teapot example</li>\n<li>An ignostic would think that that is too mild and bring up a \"Russell's cosmic grwble\" meaning that not only the [god] hypothesis is unfalsifiable, but also fundamentally meaningless.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words - an ignostic thinks that it is impossible to give a meaningful definition for the word \"[god]\" (or for that matter for the verb \"to exist\") in that context. So the question is not only unanswerable, not only false, but completely un-askable. It's gibberish.<br>\nOn the other hand, the position reverts to atheism if a possible definition of [god] is agreed on. For example, the ignostic doesn't say that the question is unanswerable given a definition of [god] and \"to exist\": if by [god] one means \"rainbows\" and by \"to exist\" one means can be seen by me with my naked eyes, then they would say that that particular \"[god]\" exists; if by [god] one means \"the old man with a beard\" of classical christianity, then they would say that that particular \"[god]\" does not exist.  </p>\n\n<p>The actual fact is that theists are completely \"allergic\" to properly define [god] and an ignostic refuses to play a cat and mouse game and argue against an ever-shifting definition.</p>\n\n<p>The point of contact between atheists and ignostics is the following: to argue about [god], atheists have to define the kind of god they argue against. For example, Dawkins argues against a particular \"personal God\" in his book \"The God delusion\". An ignostic would not have a problem with that - except maybe finding the argument a bit <em>naive</em> because it's open to accusations of being tainted by a straw-man fallacy. A Christian would simply answer that God transcends the definitions that Dawkins has given and proceed to completely dismiss the argument from that.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 675, "LastActivityDate": "2011-01-30T13:42:51.083"}

In the US, atheism is still viewed as a four-letter word, although it probably won't get you shunned by a community the way it did in 1947.  In Europe, however, the events of WWII changed a whole generation's view of religion and the Judeo-Christian god--this is a well-known phenomenon within religious academians who are concerned with this sort of thing.  One theory is that the first-hand events experienced in the UK and continental Europe jaded people's view of church, church leadership, and God's benevolence.  This non-dependence on the church is also happening in the US, but it's happening at a slower rate and is several decades behind Europe.

I lost control of my car and entered the grassy median separating the northbound and southbound lanes.  As a mere 19-year-old, I didn't have the presence of mind to try to stop my car and I did a near-180, entering the southbound lanes, facing roughly south, and doing about 15 mph. Shortly after I entered the southbound lanes, I was then rear-ended by a second tractor trailer before my car came to a stop off the side of the road.</p>\n\n<p>I stepped out of the car with a broken fingernail.  </p>\n\n<p>To this day, I point to three things that, if they had been different, I would be dead right now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That there wasn't any more traffic on the road.  This is the kind of accident that blocks all traffic in both directions for hours.</li>\n<li>That the second trucker saw me.  If he hadn't at least tried to get out of my way, he would have plowed right through me.</li>\n<li>About a mile further down the road, the highway goes under a bridge.  Had it happened a minute later, I would've bounced off of the column of the bridge and back under the first truck.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I say this because, for lack of a better word, I was, well, lucky.  I don't ascribe any supernatural power to having helped me survive that day, but I do know quite a few people who do.  The circumstances simply weren't right for my having died that day.  I can even add that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>with regard to point 1, it was well after rush hour so my having survived was as much a function of my lack of desire to be driving home during rush hour as anything.</li>\n<li>with regard to point 2, the second trucker was simply doing his job and I must say he did a good job at it.  He deserves credit where it's due and I definitely am thankful for it</li>\n<li>with regard to point 3, this one ties in at least partially with the cause of the accident.  While I can't be 100% certain what exactly resulted in the side of my car connecting with the side of the truck, one of the possible causes of it was the heavy gusts of wind that were going from the east to the west, and this might have pushed the truck at least a little bit towards me without my noticing it.  Under a bridge, that wouldn't have happened.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So I fully recognize that I don't consider this a supernatural occurrence.

The ideology itself is not really what is at issue; what is at issue is the specific, real-world threat posed by <em>adherents</em> to the ideology.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is more subtle than it seems, though.

There is no longer a concerted effort to suppress communism, for example (except in the US, more on this later). It's not that the ideology no longer exists, but that it no longer poses a real threat. So political violence is no longer seen as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Religious violence never really ends. As long as the rival ideology is seen as a rival in any way, some religious people (pretty much anyone who is truly devout) will be ready to commit violence against it.

I think it\u2019s baloney because there isn\u2019t inherently a good reason to love thy immediate neighbour more than people all over the world (other than the rather cold and calculating benefits of quid pro quo).</p>\n\n<p>To summarize: <strong>Religious allegiance is a trait that visually distinguishes us from them and strengthens patriotism.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>The second reason is that a soldier needs to be unquestioningly obedient. And that\u2019s just something I\u2019m not, even if I see why it is a good trait (most of the time) in soldiers. And being atheist is of course a departure from the unquestioning acceptance of church dogma so atheists are predestined to question seemingly stupid orders, that others would accept at face value.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize: <strong>Religion conditions people to unquestioning obedience.</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I believe that these two points make religious people better soldiers than atheists.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus: depending on your particular religious bend, you may be conditioned to embrace self-sacrifice, while atheists are inherently afraid of death. But I think this is something that  only applies to brain-washed fundamentalists: Even most religious people will still be afraid of death, to a degree that isn\u2019t noticeably less than in atheists since people have an innate survival instinct.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 82, "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-03T09:13:41.107", "CommentCount": 1}

I think you'll find the ones I described below interesting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Basic filtering - the vast majority of knowledge and experience is noise - it is not useful, interesting or applicable in anyway to anything we will ever experience again. Critical and rational thinkers train to develop good mechanisms for knowing when a piece of information truly isn't useful, interesting, or relevant, and can safely ignore it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Abstraction - the ability to extract, from a large body of knowledge, a focused bit of knowledge, which is generally useful without containing most of the knowledge that went into producing it. After filtering out all of the noise, and collecting a large amount of useful, interesting, relevant information, small bits of abstracted (focused, concentrated) knowledge can be pulled out. This is by far the most powerful, and most common used tool</p></li>\n<li><p>Specialization - most of acquired knowledge takes time and effort to think through, acquire, and communicate clearly, but doesn't require very much effort to test for correctness and accuracy. Each rational/critical thinker can specialize and analyze/collect data in one area, and then communicate focused, concentrated bits of information, with others via well established channels where their information can be quickly tested for veracity (for example, scientific journals). For example, we have so far put in, probably, on the order of 100,000 - 1,000,000 man-years worth of research into a cancer cure; if a cure is found, it almost certainly won't take nearly 100,000 years worth of knowledge to test that it works, or to learn how/why it works.</p></li>\n<li><p>Efficiency of communication - critical and rational thinkers invent specialized languages for speaking about important information, which allow for better filtering, abstraction, and exchange of information. This is connected to the basic filtering mechanism - a specialized critical thinker will strongly prefer to listen to the information other specialized critical thinkers have obtained. If the information doesn't come from one, then he's much more likely ignore it, and ignore it safely. It's much more efficient to just wait until someone specialized comes along to collect, abstract, analyze the information, and then communicate it out to the world in focused, concentrated form. For example, a mathematical researcher will likely not follow his grandmothers' medical treatment suggestions - rather, he'll pass the information along to a doctor, which might pass it along to a medical researcher, and both the doctor and mathematician will use the results of the research, rather than the original advice.</p></li>\n</ul>\n", "OwnerUserId": 240, "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-03T16:35:04.093", "CommentCount": 1}

Further reading of other authors might also be in order, in fact I know that both Dennett and Dawkins address these concerns in their books on religion.</p>\n\n<p>You should also keep in mind that though it does indeed take a very long time to derive new knowledge, it takes a whole lot less time to verify the knowledge gained by someone else.  You don't have to take anyone's word for it, you can examine the basis by which they define their knowledge.  If you find that basis valid then it can be believed.  This is neither non-critical nor irrational.</p>\n\n<p>One great method of filtering out that which you need more evidence for is Carl Sagan's Bullshit Detector, which is a lot simpler than is being explained on the Internet.  In short, the more attached to an idea you are, the more skeptical you should be of it and the more evidence you should require before believing it.  For example, Sagan's own greatest desire was to contact extra-terrestrial life.  Since it was such, he made sure to be as stringent as possible about the evidence provided for the existence of it.  In the end he wasn't able to delude himself into the kind of beliefs UFO\"ologists\" have.

It is his claim that a valid pursuit of human intellect must result in change.  For example, the pursuit of science causes us to change the way we view reality as we gain more knowledge.  He compares this to religion and concludes that because it hasn't changed in 2000 years, it's not a valid intellectual pursuit and doesn't help the human race grow.</p>\n\n<p>Although fundamentally I may agree with the latter part of that conclusion, that id doesn't help the human race grow (I'll explain why in a bit), I can't agree with the conclusion as a whole because I can't agree with the premise.  The very first thing I thought of when reading that argument was, \"What about the moderates and liberal theists that you're currently dismissing?\"</p>\n\n<p>Many of our secular ideals where first argued by theists.  John Locke for instance is considered one of the foremost and first philosophers to argue effectively for religious tolerance.  Not the kind that Harris wants us to get rid of, \"conversational tolerance\", but political tolerance.  Before this age, governments and religion where tightly coupled such that there was only one accepted religion in a country.  There where a few exceptions, but on average this is how it was.  If you did not hold the accepted religion you where often subject to persecution by the government, possibly even torture and/or execution.</p>\n\n<p>It could be easily argued that Locke didn't take it far enough because his tolerance only extended to those who HAD religious beliefs.  It was his contention that atheists couldn't be included because they had nothing holding them to oaths, honesty, and other things necessary for a solid, healthy community.  It must be accepted though that even if Locke wasn't the FIRST, he was one of the most effective; so much so that much of the philosophy that formed the United States is directly traced to him.  John Locke's arguments where 100% theistic and he based the whole thing on scripture; it's one of the main reasons that actually trying to read his argument can't hold my interest...I can't be convinced or consider it actually relevant beyond basic history because it's all based on theistic garbage think.</p>\n\n<p>It of course could be argued that any and all theistic arguments for toleration are, and have been, inspired by secularism rather than religion.  This of course may very well be true.  One of the main pieces of arguments like Harris's though is that you can't effectively argue within theism; that moderates \"protect\" fundamentalism by providing a breeding ground that can't weed them out because you can't argue against them within that framework.  Truth of the matter though is that it must be possible because, historically, it HAPPENED.  We would not live in the largely secular, liberal world today if it couldn't be done because, point of fact, religion held all power in the Western world for centuries and one of the large components of change from that where religious arguments for secular, or at least tolerant, government.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, religion DOES grow and it DOES change, and it is the liberals and \"moderates\" (not all of them are actually moderate at all) that guide that change.  In this regard they actually play a very important role in society because like it or not, most of society is religious.  There are a few, lucky countries in which this is not the case, but most of the world is not only religious, it's VERY religious.  We need the moderates and liberals who sway minds not pre-disposed to our kind of thinking.  We need the moderates and liberals who are converting a religious world to a secular ideal.  We atheists can now play a larger role in hopefully getting more recognition and acceptance, but we still need the moderates or it's just us screaming at a wall of popular misconception.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I do believe that religion holds us back rather than aid our development.  It would be better if all forms of mythical thinking where disposed of.  Even though religion does change, and that change is guided by the moderates, I think it is more due to secular pressures than pressures from within.  Furthermore, religion is slower to respond because of the fact that it's neither consistent nor based upon evidence; you can as easily argue to accept your neighbor as they are, without judgment, as you can argue they should be stoned by the community.  Neither is most of the world's population either though and this is why I think that moderates are helpful and ultimately necessary to actually changing the world.  Convincing people is only remotely attached to evidence and does require that you speak the language of the audience;  atheists simply don't.</p>\n", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-03T18:43:38.440", "CommentCount": 1}

But I think it's fairly common in Christian theology to view the primary source of the torments of hell to be the simple fact of God's complete absence. So God does not construct a place specifically to cause pain(**), but separation from the source of all good just is inherently painful. In other words, Hell is God saying to people who have rejected him \"Ok, I will give you what you asked for\".</p>\n\n<p>(*) and interestingly enough, even in Sarte's <em>No Exit</em> (though that is obviously not a Christian account of hell)</p>\n\n<p>(**) and, in fact, Hell was created not for man but for Satan (Matt. 25:41)</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 701, "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-03T23:27:08.827", "CommentCount": 2}

It might convince an rationalist, if he would believe these virgins were real, and if he would be so amorally, to kill people for his own pleasure. </p>\n\n<p>Let's get another viewpoint. I'm living in a western society, in Germany to make it concrete, and there are often psychologists asked by media to explain criminal acts which are hard to understand. But I've seen very few attempts to explain suicide bombings. Did you? Is there a fear to find ourself when searching for the answer? </p>\n\n<p>And another perspective: Our brain as atheists - is it different from the brain of theists? Is it different between theists who commit such terror, and brave theists, who won't do you any harm? Or are our brains too similar to make such a distinction? Well, there are hormones, which affect our mood and what we think, and we have influence - be it music, be it drugs, be it work or sports, ... - there is the possibility to boost them or to damp them, and a surrounding culture might tolerate, might encourage, tolerate or discourage them. </p>\n\n<p>My thesis is: Observing a coincidence of religious believes and such assassination is just the first step, is just the observation of a symptom. And religion doesn't explain much here. A serious attempt to explain such actions would try to find similar patterns in other societies and cultures, and not just see the low hanging fruit in an academic debate. A radical, nonreligious viewpoint can't accept religion as cause of such effect. </p>\n\n<p>Instead, religion is the often used shortcut to refuse reasoning, to refuse thinking, a joker where - maybe - a taboo is sitting. </p>\n\n<p>And the short form of the question is: How can we understand a jihadist without accepting his religion as explanation?

An atheist soldier might obey the command to \"take point\" (move to the front of the line) in face of massive enemy fire without hesitating, and without expecting having even a single virgin in return, although he knows that there's a 99% chance that he'll die doing so.

They do what they do because of many reasons: Desperation, anger, the will to revenge, monetary compensation to their family, threats made against them or their families, etc.  Brainwash also plays a part in this process, but this brainwash does not focus on the compensation.  It focuses on aggression and obedience, not unlike in Fascist regimes.</p>\n\n<p>As atheists, we have to view religious warfare as a <em>human</em> activity.

It would literally take a mentally handicapped individual to deal in such simplicity. Islam presents itself as a way of life and touches virtually all aspects of what a Muslim does. It is not possible for a person to embrace Islam without embracing what it stands for as a philosophy of life and an explanation for why we exist. It is a larger \"ism\" than Atheism, and 72 or 73 or 700 virgins doesn't feature in this thought process. A suitable comparison in Atheism might be the statement that \"people become atheists so that they can avoid having someone stick a silly cross on their graves after they pass away\".

This is a terrible, poisonous idea, and does not legitimize to the state of Israel. However, Zionism is not in any way a religious movement, and the real legitimacy for a Jewish state in Israel is completely secular:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Jews were already living there when history began</li>\n<li>There have been Jews living in the region at pretty much all points in history</li>\n<li>The diaspora maintained their cultural connection to Israel for centuries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I really don't see how any fair-minded person could deny the right of the Jewish people to a homeland in Israel. Religious justification is not necessary, and in fact should be condemned while still asserting the legitimacy of Zionism.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that, due to accidents of history, another people developed an equally legitimate claim to the same land. Most non-Muslims reached the conclusion some time ago that the only way to deal with this is to split the land into two states.

In contrast to the generally accepted narrative, I have come to believe that the lack of a peace agreement is due to Palestinian, not Israeli, intransigence.</p>\n\n<p>This intransigence is fueled in large part by Islamic beliefs, which outright reject the idea that a Jewish state can exist in what they consider to be \"Dar al-Islam\" (Islamic lands). Islam has limited tollerance for Jews and Christians, provided they pay special taxes and generally recognize that Islam is in charge. Israel as a Jewish state obviously violates this. In addition, the majority of Palestinians still seem to think they can turn the Israeli Jews into a minority and thereby restore Islam.

While all of these choices can be made without religion playing a role, religion does often offer a \"preconceived, ready-made template\" for groups of people to adhere to. Atheism by definition requires critical thinking, self-reliance, and often deep insight. Religion allows people to \"skip\" these steps and arrive at a fully built model for their lives, family and community.

I'm a Catholic theology grad student, by the way; I hope it is ok for me to participate in this group.</p>\n\n<p>In answer to your broader question, I would agree with tetteh that using a religion's scriptures is most useful when trying to point out flaws in the religion. You can have your little card of Biblical evil that rob suggests, and that might work with people who don't know their faith very well. My experience, however, is that when I see atheists attacking the Bible, they don't do a very good job. It's easy to take samplings from any classic ancient text and make that text look ridiculous by interpreting it in a modern context. That tactic will work with the uneducated, but anyone who really understands the text easily sees what you're doing.</p>\n\n<p>Let me make an analogy with quantum mechanics. Someone could pull out certain examples of quantum theory that would make it appear ridiculous to someone ignorant of physics. However, such arguments would not phase a real physicist who knows that the given examples represent a misunderstanding of the theory.</p>\n\n<p>To begin to correctly understand an ancient text, you must know the cultural context in which it was written. You must also understand different literary genres and try to determine when something should be taken literally or symbolically. For example, poetry is much more symbolic than history, but even with history, ancient approaches to history were different from modern approaches. I've taken philosophy courses where we studied texts from Plato and Aristotle, and they have to be approached with the same care. These techniques of analysis and interpretation are not exact and are constantly evolving. There are some things that we can say that the Bible clearly teaches, such as God made everything; Jesus is God and man; he died on the cross and rose from the dead on the third day. The age of the universe or the exact chronology of the details of Jesus' life we don't know for certain.</p>\n\n<p>So arguments that say the Bible is wrong because it says the world was created in 6 days, and science tells us it wasn't don't phase me because I don't believe the world was created in 6 days. Genesis 1 is using symbolic language of days, a forbidden fruit, and a talking snake which represent order, rebellion, and temptation. Attacks against the inconsistency of details between the four Gospels do not phase me because I know that ancient writers had no problem reordering chronology or changing peripheral details in order to serve another purpose in their writing.</p>\n\n<p>The preceding principles apply to any ancient text. We Christians traditionally see the Bible as not only a collection of ancient texts, but a collection with a unifying theme of Jesus Christ as God incarnate and savior of the world. Traditional interpretation, especially in the Catholic Church, relates everything to this theme. Therefore, Ephesians 5 which I referenced above, is about God's love for the human race expressed in the analogy of the family. The term \"be subject\" must be interpreted in the context of a loving family, and is better taken to be something like \"live in harmony with.\" Any kind of sexual slavery is completely antithetical to this interpretation.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 1035, "LastEditorUserId": 1035, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-10T03:02:55.020", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-10T03:02:55.020", "CommentCount": 5}

It's certainly possible to develop maladaptive emotional responses, such as exploding in a fit of jealous rage when your girlfriend smiles at another guy. That's irrational because smiling at someone doesn't mean much. It's a weakness because it's a reaction that would only make a bad situation worse, or a neutral or good situation bad.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about empathy in the same way shows that it's neither a weakness nor irrational. If a kitten displays behaviours which clearly demonstrate that it's experiencing pain, it's rational to respond as if it is in fact in pain. For example, if you hurt the kitten it will attack you or run away. If you persist it will grow more aggressive or fearful, or both. It's not a weakness to respond empathetically because that will end the pain, improving the situation for you and the kitten (i.e., it's an adaptive response). It's not irrational since the point of empathy is, by sharing the kitten's experience, to get you to do what's best for the kitten. The purpose of feeling empathy would have to be something different for such a response to be considered irrational. It's how <em>kittens themselves</em> learn not to hurt each other (whether or not you'd call that empathy is another debate).</p>\n\n<p>The difference, aside from the lack a nervous system, is that computers are not programmed to learn that a particular signal (i.e., the experience of pain) indicates that whatever action they performed should be avoided. Of course, as you know, they can be programmed that way. But in general they're not. They are simply programmed to avoid performing the action in the first place (or rather, not programmed to perform the action, thus obviating a need for avoidance). Alternatively, they are programmed to alert someone to their need of attention/repair, and to shut down or otherwise continue performing whatever functions are still available. Such programming is direct, specific, and limited; very different from the processes involved in experiencing and learning from pain.</p>\n\n<p>However, suppose a robot were programmed to learn from its interactions with the environment. Suppose further that it was most effective to program it to learn to generate a strong signal (i.e., pain) in response to damage (whether or not it caused the damage itself), and a similar signal would also be generated to override any action which previously caused it damage. If it is damaged, it cringes, retreats, and lets out a piercing sound, all to let anything nearby know that it has been damaged, and that whatever caused it shouldn't be repeated (even if whatever caused the damage was non-sentient). Generating the \"pain\" signal floods the robot with energy, preparing it for rapid action. However that energy can't be reclaimed, so if it's not used, it's lost. The robot releases particular fluids which also help it respond quickly and vigourously if necessary, however those fluids are damaging if they're allowed to build up. In such an unlikely scenario it would be rational to feel empathy for a robot. And in fact we probably would. There is plenty of evidence that people respond to robots as they do to humans, if the robots behave sufficiently like humans. But as far as I'm aware, no computers or robots or machines are programmed that way (and there is ample reason to think that would be <em>far</em> from the most effective implementation of damage avoidance), so it's not irrational to lack empathy for computers, but it is irrational to approximate computer programming or machine functions to the experience of animals, at least until their implementation goes beyond logical equivalence and attains fully-functional equivalence.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 658, "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-10T09:07:43.607", "CommentCount": 4}

It's clear from a thousand different examples on TV and the Internet that religious believers have a hard time conceiving living life ethically without the threats of Karma or an angry god murdering them, and the wonder why atheists don't run the street axe murdering people.  Atheists tend to rely on a kind of ethical pragmatism regarding a cost benefit ratio.</p>\n\n<p>For example, most atheists think murder is wrong.  Why?  Because they don't want to live in a society in which people are murdered, they don't want to be murdered themselves, and they don't feel the need to go murder people.  Most atheists believe that taking a life is wrong in most circumstances.  Not because a god says so, but because of the social and personal results such actions produce.  Most atheists also believe that molesting children for any reason is wrong, for the exact same pragmatic and cost/benefit reasoning I outlined above.  </p>\n\n<p>This brings us then to the issue of dogma.

I think we tend to be intolerant of that tribalism when it crosses the line of our ethics.</p>\n\n<p>So that that point, where our tolerance ends when tribalism or tradition crosses the line over ethics - is the point at which atheists like myself become intolerant of intolerance.

IE, can it recognize itself in a mirror or similar object?  Does is demonstrate an awareness of self?</li>\n<li>Does it demonstrate a capacity for planning and the execution of plans that go beyond a simple hand-to-mouth or hunt and kill capacity?</li>\n<li>Does it demonstrate an ability to organize with its peers in order to achieve its goals?</li>\n<li>Does it use language?  Can it interact with language beyond the level of simple verbal cues?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If any species demonstrated enough of these points, you would have to seriously evaluate them as a possible 'person'.  A machine intelligence may for example be able to move from hardware platform to platform with ease, not recognizing itself in any way as a function of body image - yet still demonstrate self-awareness, self-consciousness, language, planning, etc.  In that case I'd believe that intelligence to be a  person.  An ape may demonstrate self-awareness after being exposed to a mirror for a long enough time, yet never demonstrate long term planning, languaging, etc. And so I'd not believe that creature to be a person.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 524, "LastEditorUserId": 524, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-11T21:04:32.220", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-11T21:04:32.220", "CommentCount": 1}

Experiments have shown, for example, that the brain makes decisions on its own, seconds before we're \"aware\" of making that decision.

While the thoughts that make us feel as though we know ourselves are easy to experience, they are notoriously difficult to explain. So, in order to find out where they come from, Marcus subjects himself to a series of probing experiments.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe learns at what age our self-awareness emerges and whether other species share this trait. Next, he has his mind scrambled by a cutting-edge experiment in anaesthesia. Having survived that ordeal, Marcus is given an out-of-body experience in a bid to locate his true self. And in Hollywood, he learns how celebrities are helping scientists understand the microscopic activities of our brain. Finally, he takes part in a mind-reading experiment that both helps explain and radically alters his understanding of who he is.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "OwnerUserId": 122, "LastEditorUserId": 122, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-11T19:51:14.470", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-11T19:51:14.470", "CommentCount": 2}

Science doesn't deal with \"unprovable assumptions that are accepted on their very nature as being true\". It deals with assumptions supported by evidence. So I'm going to use the term <em>assumption</em> rather than axiom because it is a more appropriate term when dealing with reasoning about faith and science in the same context.  (The term 'hypothesis' would be more appropriate to science, but not to faith).</p>\n\n<p>Assumptions are not necessarily unprovable. They, along with the theories they're used to construct, are either supported by evidence, or they're not. I hold the following assumptions about the nature of reality:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The nature of reality is physical.</li>\n<li>Reality is governed by discoverable laws.</li>\n<li>The laws of physics apply everywhere in the universe.</li>\n<li>The laws of physics don't change.</li>\n<li>If there is anything 'outside' the universe, and if its influence extends 'within' the universe, that influence is governed by physical laws.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I also have these expectations of explanations of reality:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Theories explaining events within the universe must be built upon the laws of physics, at least indirectly. For example, a psychological theory is more reliable the better it incorporates biology, which incorporates chemistry, which incorporates physics. </li>\n<li>Any explanations of events must be accounted for by a coherent, cogent theory, or considered unexplained.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Assumptions 1 to 4 are not purely axiomatic; they are supported by careful, extensive observation. In all the time we've been studying the laws of physics, they've never been violated. Premise 5 follows from the previous assumptions. Someone who believes there is a spiritual aspect to reality would argue that those assumptions have been violated, for example in the case of miracles. However expectation 2 contends that unless those miracles are accounted for by a coherent theory, then they are unexplained, so the assumptions can't be considered violated.</p>\n\n<p>And that brings us to the difference between faith and science. Faith is satisfied with a leap from assumption to conclusion. Science demands that assumptions be rigorously traced to conclusions step-by-step, and also that those assumptions themselves--not just the conclusions--be supported by evidence. For example, faith contends that the assumption that God caused a miracle to occur is a sufficent explanation (as long as no other explanation is available). Science contends that without a coherent account of how God could bring about such an event, the event is unexplained.</p>\n\n<p>The question of God's existence fails in a similar way. There is no way to account for the existence of God in a coherent, cogent way in light of our understanding of reality (which includes all the evidence we've gathered). So there is no reason to consider God's existence explained, i.e., there is no reason to believe God exists. If we trace our understanding of the world through all the scientific theories and all the evidence, at some point we run into the unknown. What exactly is the nature of reality at the quantum level? Is there anything beyond? At that point the only intelligible position is to acknowledge that what lies beyond is as yet unknown. <strong>Not God by any definition. Unknown</strong>. That's not faith based upon unprovable axioms. It's reasoning supported by evidence.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 658, "LastEditorUserId": 658, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-02-21T04:49:53.230", "LastActivityDate": "2011-02-21T04:49:53.230", "CommentCount": 5}

Such responses attempt to divert attention away from the question being asked by placing the questioner under attack.

As he puts it, it is plausible that by asking too many questions and breaking the spell of those beliefs, we will end up rendering them ineffective (similar to telling a patient that they're really taking a placebo) and thereby doing real harm.  All things considered, though, Dennett comes down on the side that even though this risk exists, we should still examine the history, natural causes, benefits, and downsides of religion because the potential benefits of understanding these things outweigh the risks of breaking their spell.</p>\n\n<p>Should similar reasoning apply to all areas of life, or are there some things that should rightfully be considered taboo?  For example, is it wrong to ask questions, with scientific rigor, about whether there might be racial inequalities when it comes to intelligence and/or physical strength?  Would it be acceptable to ask whether a family of 4 that is starving would be justified in abandoning their weakest member so that the rest of them have a hope of surviving?  Should we consider the question of whether feeding the hungry in Africa hurts us all by exacerbating the population explosion that will take us all down if left unchecked?</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I do not intend to make this a discussion about the points just raised.  They are merely examples of controversial questions on topics that have \"obvious\", socially acceptable answers - of course racism is wrong, and of course all human life is sacred and no one should be intentionally sacrificed for the benefit of others.

Once the major religions learned that (yeah, right) they'd have to confront their own lack of ethics and deal with that problem.</p>\n\n<p>Science has a lot to learn about religion.  For example, what the epileptic seizures are that people call 'religious experience', and how to cure that.  We also need to learn more about how to educate children so that they don't become so easily infected by religious memes.  </p>\n\n<p>There's a lot that both sides can learn from each other.</p>\n\n<p>To edit and update this:</p>\n\n<p>To claim that just because stimulating the brain produces results in other areas invalidates the investigations into temporal lobe epilepsy is fatuous.  Either you believe that the brain produces religious experiences, or you believe in magic.  Since I choose to rule out magic, we're left with the brain as a source, and if it's in the brain we can quite possibly cure the sickness of religion.</p>\n\n<p>Here's that quote from wikipedia on temporal lobe epilepsy and religious experience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with TLE was neurologist Norman Geschwind, who noted a constellation of symptoms, including hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, fainting spells, and pedantism, often collectively ascribed to a condition known as Geschwind syndrome.</p>\n  \n  <p>Vilayanur S. Ramachandran explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using galvanic skin response (which correlates with emotional arousal) to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998). By presenting subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR, Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. These results suggest that the medial temporal lobe is specifically involved in generating some of the emotional reactions associated with religious words, images and symbols.</p>\n  \n  <p>Cognitive neuroscience researcher Michael Persinger asserts that stimulating the temporal lobe electromagnetically can cause TLE and trigger hallucinations of apparent paranormal phenomena such as ghosts and UFOs. Persinger has even created a \"God helmet\" which purportedly can evoke altered states of consciousness through stimulation of the parietal and temporal lobes. Neurotheologians speculate that individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, having a natural tendency to experience states of consciousness such as euphoria or sam\u0101dhi, have functioned in human history as religious figures or shamans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are thousands and thousands of anecdotal reports and some study based evidence that messing with brain chemistry produces primary religious experience.  It is well known that LSD and mescaline users report 'seeing god' and other such nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>It is not a far leap to therefore locate the source of \"primary religious/ecstatic experience\" in the physical and chemical makeup of the brain.  If this proves to be the case, there's substantial hope that we could cure this kind of brain malfunction and increase the baseline rationality of the afflicted.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 524, "LastEditorUserId": 524, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-03-01T06:07:38.797", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-01T06:07:38.797", "CommentCount": 11}

Well, again, depends what you mean by meaning.  There is a curiously powerful semi-tautological meaning in the life process.  First, notice that natural selection has shaped us to be exquisitely good self-replicators (in a very complex way, not the bacterial \"let's eat everything as fast as we possibly can!\" way--though on the largest scale, we have a tendency to revert to that behavior).  We act as though the most important thing to us is perpetuating our genes--and given that our genes are shared to an astounding extent between us, one can argue that our more noble aspirations to embrace the brotherhood of mankind is just an intuition that matches up with the biological reality: some genetic differences are important, but for the most part, we're all pretty similar, and we're all built to want to propagate our genes / our tribe's genes / our species' genes.  You don't get the overarching morality of religion from this observation, but if we have been selected and have all the instincts and desires and so on to want to continue the species, you'd have to conclude that it was at the very least pretty wrong-headed for anyone to do anything that would seriously jeopardize that.  (Start a global thermonuclear war, for example.)</p>\n\n<p>And then you might notice that if you really don't care about it all, and don't bother taking part in the continuation of the species (either directly, by having children, or indirectly, by contributing to society and trying to avoid some of our worst excesses that threaten our future), and die, then you're gone, and what you did pretty much didn't matter: a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And those people who <em>do</em> care about keeping humanity going, to the extent that they manage to do it, also get their prophecy fulfilled: their offspring (collectively, not of each individual necessarily) are still around, and thus what they did mattered (inasmuch as anything matters to anyone ever, by virtue of it mattering to individuals who are present at various times).</p>\n\n<p>So, put simply: we are a type of creature who tries to perpetuate the species.  Embracing this and using it to guide one's morality is about as non-controversial of a move as you can get.  I'm not sure that if you fail to do that one can say that you're <em>wrong</em>, but one could make a good case that you're <em>broken</em> (in the \"evolutionary unfit\" sense).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, we don't really need to make the logical step--our instincts do most of the work for us.  (We care about our children, even to the point of sacrificing our lives for them at times, for example.)  But it's a weird and complex world that we've built for ourselves these days, and our instincts don't always get it right any more.

Every time I see a picture or poster of Toulouse-Lautrec, I have to think of that uncle. Am I free not to think of him? Well, I'm not absolutely sure that I really think every time of him. Thoughts are sometimes so elusive. </p>\n\n<p>Now let's do a thought experiment: Here is a cup of coffee, and a coin. I flip the coin - if it shows a number, I will drink the coffee with sugar, if it shows the head I will drink it without. Am I free to do either so or so, just depending on the unpredictable outcome of the coin-experiment? \nWell - what does the experiment tell us? Well, one single experiment: Not so much, because maybe I threw a number, and drank with sugar, but maybe I would haven't drunk it without, even if I threw it with the head upside? \nBut I can repeat and repeat the experiment, and if I throw it 10 times, the chances that I always match what I wanted to do anyway gets smaller and smaller, 1/(2^10) = 1/1024. </p>\n\n<p>But now look back what I made: I set up a total deterministic regularization to prove that my actions aren't determined; absurd? Have I been free to interrupt the experiment at every time, or was I punished by an inner or outer force to do what I did? Well - it was just a thought experiment - it didn't prove anything so far, as long as I didn't do anything for real. Did I? \nAnd I can tell you: yes, I did, and so can you! And I can assure you, it's a surrealistic experience to think about your freedom to violate the rules in every step. 10 cups of coffee is a lot of coffee if you like to get things done - here is a minor modification of the rules, which you can test immediately: </p>\n\n<pre><code>* Throw a dice, or pull from a deck of cards, or use a random generator, to produce some numbers.\n* Knock according to what you have thrown on something in your reach - if you threw a 3, knock 3 times, if you pulled a 8 knock 8 times, for As 1x and for King, Queen, ... 10x, Joker 0x.\n* Repeat it 5 to 10 times, but choose how often before, and write it down, because else you could fool yourself, it's very easy. :) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For Linux-users, and maybe BSD: here is a small shellcommand if you're too lazy to search cards or dice:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for i in {1..10}; do echo -n $((RANDOM%10))\" \"; done ; echo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So did you do that? Now either there was an implausible luck. I don't think so. 1/(10^5) = 1/10 000, 1/(10^10) = 1/10 000 000 000. \nOr else, you were free to choose to stick to the rules and follow them slavishly, but were forced to knock how often the rules told you to do. Or you stopped the experiment, and now you know you're not free to follow such an experiment :) Are you free?</p>\n\n<p>Doesn't this count, because it is of minor importance to you, how often you knock on wood? But importance and freedom are orthogonal concepts, aren't they? If you're free in important decisions, you're free in less important ones and vice versa - no? </p>\n\n<p>Some people seem to think that freedom would mean that you decide what to do without influence from your culture and from your history. But you and me, we are historic beings, we have a history, we have experiences, values. We have time to prove our values every day, and we decided to stick to them, and sometimes we didn't. </p>\n\n<p>So if I do something today, which is pretty predictable, for example I prefer a bit of sugar in the coffee - that's my freedom. My freedom is to decide on my own whether I fear to get fat and ugly from too much sugar, or not. Whether I prefer a sweet taste or a bitter one. Of course it is influenced by my history and it might correlate extremely with neurons in my brain which could be measured. But if I change my decisions, the neurons would behave in another way. But there is no distinction between what the neurons do and my decisions. \nYou have to admit that those neurons in action <strong>are</strong> my free thoughts. It's a different kind of perspective, it's looking at them with a microscope. You don't see much if you come too close. </p>\n\n<p>Only if you claim that your brain isn't you, that it is something foreign, that electrons, neurons and nerves - that it isn't you, but your brain which is thinking, that you can make a distinction between your thoughts as a physical/chemical/biological event and an historical/juristic/philosophical one; only then you can fall into the illusion of being a  heteronomous robot.</p>\n\n<p>Don't forget your experiment! ;) </p>\n\n<p>And hey! It's 21st century, you just have to knock on wood, not to sacrifice your son, like Abraham. :) But that was another experiment. It dealt with obedience. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 992, "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-02T02:56:18.520", "CommentCount": 13}

In the realm of mathematic theorems that have been extensively studied, there is not much doubt about the validity of the proof itself. The doubtful part is what its implications are and how (or if) it relates to our life.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Simply put, Goedel's theorem states that if a mathematical theory is sufficiently complex (contains <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peano's arithmetic</a>, so you can count using integers), there are true statements that cannot be proven within the theory.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is where this becomes interesting. Since you can count, you could argue that your internal theory about the world contains Peano's arithmetic. As a consequence (providing your theory of the world is consistent), you can never prove every single truth, even if given infinite means.</p>\n\n<p>There have been arguments that this idea is flawed, since people make mistakes and their theories about the world are thus inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>Which means that either you are consistent and do not make mistakes and you will never know every truth (replace \"you\" with \"humankind past, present and future\", same thing for these purposes), or you make mistakes and are inconsistent and thus you actually might know every truth, but sadly, thanks to inconsistency, you would also know every falsehood - it would logically be all the same to you.</p>\n\n<p>It can be argued that embracing Goedel's theorem leads to eastern philosophies that appear to reject consistency (a statement can be both true and false at the same time), and in exchange provide the potentail to gain the ultimate knowledge (which at the same time happens to be a complete lack of knowledge).</p>\n\n<p>This is also seems to be reflected in Christianity, where you are told that you should abandon your logic and replace it with belief.

Thinking logically means being eternally limited with no means of escaping that jail. The only way out means to abandon logic. It seems that if we used strict logic for ruling our everyday affairs, thinking everything to its ultimate consequences, we would have to behave like pure lunatics (our theories are necessarily inconsistent, single inconsistency spoils the entire theory, making every statement both true and false at the same time, you cannot really make decisions if everything is true and false at once!).

Godel statements, can be stated in the syntax of the logical system, but cannot be proven true or false by following logical steps of derivation/proof from the stated axioms of the system. As such, any further statement derived from an assumption of true/false of a Godel statement will have no relevance to statements that can be proven within the system. </p>\n\n<p>So, the question is really about relevance. If we have system that is a model of some real world situation, such a system can be be fully predictive and explanatory even though it contains Godel statements. Chances are that the Godel Statements, while phrased logically, simple bear no true relevance to what the system is representing. And that is the important thing to remember- these systems, in the case of the real world, represent/model it. Statements that are purely logical may not have an analog in the represented/real system. </p>\n\n<p>A glaring example of this is that mathematicians assign the status of any specific equation as a Godel Statement to very few statements. Some claim that this is because the Godel Statements, when found, are simply incorporated as new axioms for the systems.  This would be because the derivations of such statements would be useful for a particular sub-field in math. Take Euclid's Parallel Postulate as an example. This postulate was found to be unprovable from the rest of the axioms of geometry. It's incorporation as an axiom is what allows for Euclidean geometry to be a sensible system and it derivatives include important results, such as the Pythagorean theorem. All these useful things are based on the assumptions of truth of certain statements- the axioms. And from this view all axioms are Godel statements, for if a given axiom is instead accepted as a theorem then it is unprovable from the other axioms. (as axioms are independent of each other by definition, in the sense that they cannot be derived from on another)</p>\n\n<p>So in the end with logic- we must always start somewhere. We must assume the truth of certain unprovable things that are not in contradiction with each other. The question is- are the logical derivatives of these axioms useful: do they represent what we see around us? There is nothing that says what we see around us cannot be represented completely and logically. Godel Statements do not undermine the representational power and efficiency of logical systems.</p>\n\n<p>This is all presented as evidence for what I think the main problem with your train of thought is: \"It seems that if we used strict logic for ruling our everyday affairs, thinking everything to its ultimate consequences, we would have to behave like pure lunatics (our theories are necessarily inconsistent, single inconsistency spoils the entire theory, making every statement both true and false at the same time, you cannot really make decisions if everything is true and false at once!)\" particularly the part about inconsistency ruining the entire theory- which seems to be a premise throughout your question. </p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 1107, "LastEditorUserId": 1107, "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-03-05T22:05:57.760", "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-05T22:05:57.760", "CommentCount": 7}

The Catholic Church makes huge monetary donations to charity, but it obstructs justice in the case of deviant priests.</p>\n\n<p>What I think is an illustrating example is religion without structure- what some would call \"spirituality.\" Some would argue that the delusion itself is harmful, even so harmful that it overcomes the positive effects. (Which in my view a very strong stance) But that does not mean that it doesn't have any positive effects (just that they are overrun.) One could ask a spiritual person what the positive effects are and some that most likely be on that list are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-A sense of belonging in a group\n-A salve on the apprehension associated with mortality\n-A foundation of morality\n-A larger meaning to the universe\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And etc. One gets a sense the benefit spiritual people would ascribe to their beliefs is psychological in nature. I believe that these feelings would be bolstered in structured setting. So it should apply to all religion. </p>\n\n<p>The contention I can see with all this is that such benefits could arguably not be real and just part of a deluded sense that some attribute the religious. I would use the evidence of success in 12-step programs (Alcoholic Anonymous, etc) to support the idea that these psychological benefits, though not exclusive to religion, are real. </p>\n\n<p>So the question is tricky. The risk of committing to a belief that is unsubstantiated can be in itself harmful. The humans who rise to ascendancy in the structures based on these beliefs have tremendous influence, and, as humans, sometimes tend to abuse power for personal gains. But the individuals who are components of these religions cannot have the right removed from them to say that it has bettered their lives. </p>\n\n<p>One final point: it's a form of loading to ask this question in an atheist's forum. Anyone could predict the answers. For the best answer- ask someone you who think is intelligent and honest and who has been or is involved with religion.

I will focus on answering with a summary that includes failings of one particular group, negationists of the latter half of the 1800s (i.e. Anarchists, Nihilists, etc).</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>The Rebel</strong> by Camus, there is a section that builds up a hypothesis of morality's development moving forward from the negationist philosophies of Pisarev, Nechaiev, Bielinsky, and Bakunin. For further background I recommend reading the whole section on \"Historical Rebellion\" in <strong>The Rebel</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>He begins moving forward with the 1860s, which \"began, apparently, with the most radical negation imaginable: the rejection of any action that was not purely egoistic (Camus 154).\" This can be seen in Fathers and Sons (Turgenev 1862), in which the term nihilism is coined; for whom \"the only value resides in rational egoism\" according to Camus. This laid a foundation for developing a non-positivist ethics, a cynical ethics as Camus would describe it.</p>\n\n<p>However, he continues with a criticism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reason among the nihilists, strangely enough, annexed the prejudices of faith; choosing the most popularized forms of science-worship for their prototype of reason was not the least of the contradictions accepted by these individualists. (Camus 155)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The criticism is not due to the association with faith, actually, it is that they didn't sufficiently adopt skepticism as their model. Instead, they opened the door for nihilism to give way to socialism; \"they chose to propagate a doctrine and became socialists (Camus 155).\" From here, Camus cites two specific examples that are the threshold of Morality after this point, both of which seeking to rationalize the contradiction of [faith and doctrine] within [nihilism and rationalist egoism]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Veidle quotes... Soloviev... in denouncing this contradiction: \"Man is descended from monkeys, therefore let us love one another.\" Pisarev's truth, however, is to be found in this dilemma. If man isthe image of God, then it doess not matter thaat  he is deprived of human love; the day will come when he will be satiated with it. But if he is a blind creature, wandering the darkness of a cruel and circumscribed condition, he has need of his equals and of their ephemeral love  (Camus 155).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The movement began wanting to live life egoistically, subject only to reason, but eventually Bakunin (a contemporary revolutionary and collectivist anarchist) was of the sentiment that \"He who has understood reality does not rebel against it, but rejoices in it; in other words, he becomes a conformist (Camus 156).\" For Bakunin, evil was simply the rebellion against the divine (or less figuratively, \"established\") will. It was not a categorical disposittion, rather a relative position. </p>\n\n<p>For some negationists, science was an idol of their time. For Bakunin, it represented yet another figurehead of oppression. Nonetheless, he was an editor of the International Fraternity (1864-7), which established subordination of the individual to central committee (Camus 159). In developing some kind of ethics or morality or any other form of applied value-judgment system, negation was a first step, wherein all things were abandoned to the ego. However, each proponent seemed to mire in their own idolatry, allowing their ego and the ego of their brethren to be subsumed in the process.</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 135, "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-06T20:49:20.093"}

However you aren\u2019t asking for that to be addressed. </p>\n\n<p>You asked in the present tense, which makes it more difficult. Religion formerly had much more power and influence, so their impact on education, charity, politics and healing was greater. But that could be asked later. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Look around at the names of hospitals. Although this is just big business now, pioneering health facilities has been a traditional religion role. Mission work continues to include healing as one of the things it does. </li>\n<li>Moral education and youth programs. There is more to education than math, science and sports. A place to discuss just what \u201clove your neighbor\u201d means is important for a growing mind. </li>\n<li>Counseling. From integrating military personnel back into society to helping a youth at risk to understand the consequences of his or her actions. Secular institutions have done a pretty poor job of this, unless you can afford $100 an hour once a week. </li>\n<li>Charity. I\u2019m not sure what the administration costs are compared to secular charities, but the question isn\u2019t \u201care they better at it\u201d, the question is \u201chave impacts\u201d. It would be difficult to determine if people would give to secular charities if they were not going to church. As someone who has run programs needing volunteers, I know it is good to partner with churches. You just let one person know you need people and you get 10 or 100 people to show up.</li>\n<li>Tempering leadership. Unfortunately this is not true in all cases, and lately it seems like it is true in the minority of cases, but the sense that religion can give to a leader that he has a moral responsibility beyond his lifetime and a responsibility to give and to protect can keep that power in check. </li>\n<li>Renewal. Sundays are secularized now, but the ideas that there should be a sanctuary from war and a time of rest from work are traditionally religious. The relationship of stress and sickness bears out the value of this need for rest. </li>\n<li>Political change. Obviously there are differences of opinion on what is positive or negative, but the pulpit is a way to get people thinking about their ideologies. A case can be made for how religion kept slavery in place, but the history of abolition also shows a strong religious influence. </li>\n<li>Keepers of the rituals. Really too much to go into here, and you would have to agree on the positive impact of ritual to agree that performing them is positive. I\u2019m speaking of the ritualization of things as a means to keep them from taking over your life. An occasional glass of wine is healthy, bottles of it in brown paper bags all day is not. Also the rites of passage, so a young boy or girl recognizes, and knows others recognize they are maturing. </li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": 584, "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-07T14:28:47.833", "CommentCount": 2}

This is flawed reasoning, again, because it is not taking into account the value of convention. Besides, not everyone has the inclination, time and knowledge to do \"research\". Same goes for Windows vs. Ubuntu: my mom, for example, wants something that works and which she can use straightaway. She is not willing to do \"research\"; she is comfortable with convention. Only a very small minority of us are willing and able to do that research that you call for.</p>\n\n<p>So, I fully disagree with your claim that people's use of Windows is akin to religion. Windows is just a useful convention that eliminates unnecessary barriers.

Maybe it's an offshoot of a pre-existing idea and maybe it's a completely new one.  The idea always begins with attempts to answer the big unanswerable questions (and maybe even by posing such unanswerable questions on their own).  Questions like:  \"why are we here?\"  \"what happens when you die?\"  \"what is the 'right' thing to do in such-and-such circumstance?\" (with that last question, it's one of those general moral dilemmas that are natural offshoots of living in a complex world, and generally touch on questions like: may I commit some unspeakable atrocity against one person if I knew the result would be the betterment of the lives of countless others?)</p>\n\n<p>Then the person talks about the idea and finds that he (historically it has been a 'he' more often than not but there's nothing preventing the person from being a woman) is a gifted speaker, charismatic, and a small band of people start listening to him, taking his words as being truthful and regarding the original person as their leader.</p>\n\n<p>After that, the followers start to echo the words of the leader and start to communicate it on a wider scale.  There may be some misinterpretations along the way, but what's important here is not the misinterpretations but rather the fact that more and more people will now listen to the words of the leader -- or the retellings of those words if the leader is not available for any reason.  It may also represent a threat to the status quo in the world of politics or pre-existing religion.  At this stage, the idea and its leader can fairly be termed a \"cult\".</p>\n\n<p>Once we have reached the status of a cult, one of two things is going to happen:  the idea will die out, or it will persist.  The idea may die out because of infighting among the followers, or it may die out because the leader himself (see above about my use of the male-specific pronoun) died, or even because it was quashed by the powers-that-be.</p>\n\n<p>If the idea persists, however, it is because a sufficiently large and convincing group of people were enabled the cult to grow larger.  There will be more and more compromises of the original idea in the hopes of gaining more converts (i.e., assimilating pre-existing religious ideas into the new one).  There will come a tipping point sometime after that, then, when the cult gains some degree of social and political clout and recognition.  At this stage, it is a \"religion\".</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once it's a religion, there will always be the chance that new ideas and new charismatic leaders might induce some to break away and form a new cult, which, over time, could become a new religion, and thus the cycle continues.</p>\n\n<p>Even though it wasn't a part of the original question, it certainly bears mentioning that the main difference between a cult and a religion is the number of followers and amount of political clout.  I don't have any sense of what the magic number of followers needs to be in order to make the transition, but if you look at modern-day cults such as the Branch Davidians, Jews for Jesus, Jonestown, Heaven's Gate, Raelians, etc., and compare them with early Christians, Mormons, Jews, Hindus, and Muslims, etc., you're not going to see a whole lot of differences....</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": 205, "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-10T17:09:00.040", "CommentCount": 7}

Jeremy Gunn</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the \"essentialist\"; where one picks a single trait shared among all, ie. \"All Religions believe in a g/God\"</li>\n<li>the \"polythetic\"; where the religions are not bound by a singular, essential trait but by shared <strong>familial</strong> traits. To explain the latter, he references a 1965 US Supreme Court quote: \"[T]he test of belief \u201cin a relation to a Supreme Being\u201d [in a law providing for conscientious objector status from military service] is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He also explains that religion can be culled together as <a href=\"http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/gunn.shtml#Heading68\" rel=\"nofollow\">Belief, Identity, and a Way of Life</a>.

The plain\n  fact is, religion must die for mankind\n  to live. The hour is getting very late\n  to be able to indulge in having in key\n  decisions made by religious people. By\n  irrationalists, by those who would\n  steer the ship of state not by a\n  compass, but by the equivalent of\n  reading the entrails of a chicken.\n  George Bush prayed a lot about Iraq,\n  but he didn't learn a lot about it.\n  Faith means making a virtue out of not\n  thinking. It's nothing to brag about.\n  And those who preach faith, and enable\n  and elevate it are intellectual\n  slaveholders, keeping mankind in a\n  bondage to fantasy and nonsense that\n  has spawned and justified so much\n  lunacy and destruction. Religion is\n  dangerous because it allows human\n  beings who don't have all the answers\n  to think that they do. Most people\n  would think it's wonderful when\n  someone says, \"I'm willing, Lord! I'll\n  do whatever you want me to do!\" Except\n  that since there are no gods actually\n  talking to us, that void is filled in\n  by people with their own corruptions\n  and limitations and agendas. And\n  anyone who tells you they know, they\n  just know what happens when you die, I\n  promise you, you don't. How can I be\n  so sure? Because I don't know, and you\n  do not possess mental powers that I do\n  not. The only appropriate attitude for\n  man to have about the big questions is\n  not the arrogant certitude that is the\n  hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt\n  is humble, and that's what man needs\n  to be, considering that human history\n  is just a litany of getting shit dead\n  wrong. This is why rational people,\n  anti-religionists, must end their\n  timidity and come out of the closet\n  and assert themselves. And those who\n  consider themselves only moderately\n  religious really need to look in the\n  mirror and realize that the solace and\n  comfort that religion brings you\n  actually comes at a terrible price. If\n  you belonged to a political party or a\n  social club that was tied to as much\n  bigotry, misogyny, homophobia,\n  violence, and sheer ignorance as\n  religion is, you'd resign in protest.\n  To do otherwise is to be an enabler, a\n  mafia wife, for the true devils of\n  extremism that draw their legitimacy\n  from the billions of their fellow\n  travelers. If the world does come to\n  an end here, or wherever, or if it\n  limps into the future, decimated by\n  the effects of religion-inspired\n  nuclear terrorism, let's remember what\n  the real problem was that we learned\n  how to precipitate mass death before\n  we got past the neurological disorder\n  of wishing for it.

For example, we tend to be much more horrified when someone kills a baby than when someone kills an (adult) baboon, even though the baboon is arguably more cognitively complex and probably possesses a keener sense of suffering (simply because it is more aware).  We also tend to be outraged even when the baby is killed in an entirely painless fashion; most fish almost certainly suffer more.</p>\n\n<p>It makes much more sense to me to assume that our moral sense is honed to be useful on evolutionary scales to intelligent social creatures.  Of <em>course</em> we are horrified when harm comes to our young, since without young we'll go extinct!  And, naturally, when dealing with other smart and motivated creatures with whom you can communicate, it's almost always better to communicate and reach some agreement than act unilaterally and provoke a violent response.  So feeling empathy etc. is a useful first step: it makes you want to understand, help, engage in reciprocally beneficial actions, and so on, instead of using violence to mediate between different goals.  (Many animals do the same when trying to attract a mate: males have a variety of ways to judge standing and strength beyond actually testing it in a fight.  We just have a lot more options because we're much better at communicating and understanding complex concepts.)</p>\n\n<p>But if our moral sense arises from very practical issues regarding our survival as a species, then it <em>doesn't matter</em> when some entirely unrelated entity appears.  If we're sympathetic to, say, a cute little baby monkey, that can make some sense; we share a lot of genes with monkeys, and we're probably better off with more diversity of life (more robust) and it's generally better to engage our sympathetic feelings widely rather than err in the other direction and fail to extend them even where they're critically important (\"the enemy is pure evil!\").</p>\n\n<p>But why be sympathetic in the same way to an organoelectronic thing that has arrived from some distant star?

(Though one could argue that instant annihilation is another relatively safe strategy if you can pull it off--as long as you're clearly the more powerful one, and the other side doesn't have powerful friends of which you're unaware.)  But I don't think we're in any way morally obligated to put its interests ahead of ours because that's <em>not what morality is for</em>.  If we could be convinced, somehow, that said thing would guard us and assure us of our continued survival better than we could ourselves, then maybe there's an argument to make that we should place less value on our individual lives than its.

(About anything we claim to have a belief in... not just &quot;God.&quot;)</a></p>\n\n<p>The main point I was making was that I believe that questions about the nature of \"free will\" are more easily answered and understood when we get more explicit about what \"choice\" means. When we're talking about \"choice\" here's what I think is actually going on:</p>\n\n<p>There is a set S of perceived (or predicted) outcomes. When we make a \"choice\", we select exactly one element from S.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose S has two elements: A and B. What is the process by which we decide whether to select A or B? I contend that the process is complex but can be described simply: We measure both A and B according to which we find the most desirable. If desire(X) is a function of how much we desire outcome X, then if desire(A) > desire(B), then we select A from S. That's it. The complexity of the desire() function is something for another discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Now maybe this is something we feel is intuitively true, but I think actually writing it out is important, at least to me. It reveals a couple of things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We can't \"choose\" what we don't want. We will always \"choose\" the outcome that we perceive to be the most desirable.</li>\n<li>What we desire determines our choices.</li>\n<li>If we are capable of \"choosing\" what we desire, it is merely a meta-operation; some subset of our desires is not chosen.</li>\n<li>As an atheist I don't mind reasoning that my choices are merely a product of my desires (I always get to pick what I want! :P), but this is far more troublesome for those who believe they were created by an entity who cares what they choose -- and must have, in one way or another, seeded them with desires that determined those choices.</li>\n</ol>\n", "OwnerUserId": 335, "LastActivityDate": "2011-03-17T00:59:19.573"}
