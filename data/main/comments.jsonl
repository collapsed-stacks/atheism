A definition of atheism which doesn't depend on specific theistic definitions of god could be academically useful. My point is that atheism is, by definition, and in practice, a lack of belief in god. Implicitly, specific definitions of god.

Religion often uses tactics that appeal to emotion, and make outrageous claims about having all the answers. Science has to be careful about that, it can only point to what it has done, and must be open about its mistakes, and it doesn't get to skip steps and make leaps of faith. That is a harder sell. There is plenty of wonder though, and sometimes it borders on magic, which can be fun, interesting and appealling. ", "CreationDate": "2011-03-01T15:54:48.887", "UserId": 584}
