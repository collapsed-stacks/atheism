In this debate, Boteach comes off like a Jewish Bill O'Reilly; but, they both agree on this non-trivial bet (originally proposed by Boteach) whereby the loser had to buy 100 books from the winner and distribute them to the loser's colleges. The bet was over some ruling in an Isreal rabbinical court: I'm not sure of the background of the referenced case -- feel free to clear it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 1:03 Boteach reads a statement from Hitchen's book:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Speaking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Baruch Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, Christopher Hitchens writes while serving as a physician in the Israeli Army he had announced that he would not treat non-Jewish patients such as Isreali Arabs on the sabbath as it happens he was obeying Rabbinic law and declining not to do this, as many Israeli courts had confirmed.&quot; - Boteach&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going on, he says&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I challenge Mr. Hitchens to name a single Jewish court in the entire world that would ever rule that a non-Jew should not be treated on the Sabbath. In fact, if he names it I will buy a 100 copies of his book and I will give it to [...] my religious friends; but, if he fails I challenge him to buy 100 copies of my book.&quot; - Boteach&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At about 1:06 Boteach makes a statement to counter one of Hitchens's statements that I presume comes from his book:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;That it is a slander to say, against Jews, that any Jewish court would say that non Jews should not be treated, and the state of Israel treats every single Arab and Palestinian even when terrorists are brought to hospitals.&quot; - Boteach&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The exchange gets quite directed at around 1:10, and the civility degrades until the conclusion of the pissing contest. At around 1:14 we find Boteach summarizing the bet:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;I just wanna repeat that we heard tonight that a high rabbinical court said you could not save a non-Jewish life on the sabbath, that is absolutely false.&quot;  - Boteach&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hitchen's apparently affirming he accepts this chants in the background &lt;em&gt;&quot;100 books riding on this.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;  You again hear both of them chanting in agreement &quot;100 books&quot; in the last 5 seconds of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Shahak#Alleged_telephone_incident&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia indicates Hitchens won&lt;/a&gt;.

Atheists take it on evidence that there is no god - or rather lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arguments for:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence claimed by believers can be examined. In which case, you would most probalby find that there isn't nearly enough of it. The hypothesis, for example, that the god of the Torah exists, is backed up by a few bits of evidence, like miracles and so on&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A scientific examination of this evidence will, to all impartial analysis, turn up &lt;strong&gt;no result&lt;/strong&gt;. All evidence can be &lt;em&gt;explained away&lt;/em&gt; so to speak, until there isn't much left. It is therefore necessary to conclude that no evidence could be found, thus there is no god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arguments against:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you were believing in Russel's tea pot: Wether the tea pot exists or not is not up to scientific debate, because it doesn't suppose something that is observable, nor something that has any observable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore, with all the necessary scientific rigour, an &lt;strong&gt;unanswerable&lt;/strong&gt; question. The good practices of science dictate that this question be answered negatively,  until any evidence to the contrary turns up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is examining the question of the existence of god, or gods, as a classical scientific hypothesis. Most often, historically, the question has been asked as a philosophical one. Which is a different thing altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Philosophy provides many tools to answer this question, only one of which is Logic. It is obviously to be answered negatively using classical logical reasoning. But there are philosophical paths which can legitimately, following all of their rules and standards, answer it positively. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will find, for example, that it makes perfect sense from a post modern relativistic point of view to suppose there may well be a god or gods. These discussions must be answered by questioning the validity of the methodology itself, instead of engaging in it's style of discussion, the same goes the other way 'round of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we allow every kind of reasoning, we will get every possible answer. If we restrict the applicable methodology to, for example, logic, or the scientific method, we will find the answer is No.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is of course no proof, by definition. From a strict scientific point of view, there is no god until we get more evidence. &lt;strong&gt;This we don't take on faith any more than gravity or evolution&lt;/strong&gt;. We judge it by it's observable effects. If there is no effect, there is no agent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you've updated your question, I'll add this little bit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If people regard your lack of religiosity as not being based on evidence - or as being based on unsubstantiated evidence, they must provide reasons for it. Otherwise, you needn't take them seriously. You need not, as you may think at first, disprove their assertions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One must be careful to keep in mind that one is refusing to accept an assertion, rather than making one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In practice&lt;/strong&gt;, arguments that lack of religious belief is based on &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; often rely on misconceptions and fallacies about science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just one example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The scientific principle of falsifiability must apply and if not answered, renders the question unscientific. Here's the fallacy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unanswerable question is one that you can answer &quot;any way you like&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An argument employing this fallacy is easily contradicted. And I'll assert that many of the &lt;em&gt;&quot;atheists are believers too&quot;&lt;/em&gt;-arguments are employing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And here's the logical proof to refute it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if a question is unanswerable, it can (a) have no knowable answers or (b) have no answers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a: There is no way prove any answer, therefore the correctness of no answer can be established, therefore no answer is found to be correct,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;b: There are no answers, therefore there are no right answers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;therefore every answer is to be considered wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or to put it in context, if we can't know there is no god (which hasn't been established here remember), we must assume there is no god, until further evidence is provided or the prerequisites to the question change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="47" LastEditorUserId="47" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-03-14T16:43:54.510" LastActivityDate="2011-03-14T16:43:54.510" CommentCount="8" />

For example, a contracting muscle converts chemical energy stored in ATP into movement and heat - most of it into heat, some of it into movement. Heat dissipates into the surrounding - the body becomes colder, the surroundings warmer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When someone dies, the body contains energy in the form of heat and various chemical elements. The heat dissipates fairly quickly - the body cools, the surroundings get warmer. The chemical energy would stay in the body, except that various other organisms try to take advantage of the large amount of defenseless energy available in one place. The carcass of an animal that has died in the wild will be quickly consumed - by other animals, by insects and by bacteria. The same thing happens to humans.

As an atheist you may expect me to say no; but if I'm being honest, I'd have to consider myself a spiritual person. Of course I'm not talking about some ghostly ethereal soul that lives inside my body. There's no reason to think there's anything like that. I'm talking about the essence of human. There aren't many words in our language that capture what that is. at least for me. And so I use the word spirit, in the same way I use the phrase bless you. For rhetoric's sake. I can only describe it as the action or ability to see beauty. to feel wonder. and to be in awe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Religion and all groups faith of course serve only to prostitute the awe, and the mystery we all feel as humans. they bottle our essence and try putting lid on the wonder we naturally feel. They fail of course. Religion points to the man behind the curtain in an attempt answer the mystery. when in reality, there is no man. the mystery is just that. a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;But even though I don't believe in the supernatural, I try to be as honest as I can to myself, about my spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;On my trip out west just a couple months ago I remember a moment standing in a field that looked up at the grand tetons. the tetons in wyoming are these massive glacier capped mountains that just cut into the sky. I remember thinking to myself. Something much greater than me must have caused this. I know it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I also remember sleeping out underneath a cool and clear sky next to the dunes in white sands national park. Looking up all I could see was just a pile of stars. More than I'd ever understood to exist. Looking at them all, still and perfect, and vast beyond my ability to comprehend, I felt uncommonly humble. And grateful just to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There are moments when I'm with good friends, where it just feels good to breath. The taste of chilled apple butter on a warm buttermilk biscuit is often more than delicious, to me it feels enlightening. And a soft kiss to me can honestly stop time and space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;At times I can be so overwhelmed by the sensation of being alive, that I cry. or I laugh. or I scream. or I just breath deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And no, I never once imagine that to be supernatural. I understand, that the thing that is so much greater than me, to have caused the Tetons has a name. and it's called plate tectonics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That being humble is simply the feeling of recognizing the reality of ones small significance to a universe so massive.

What is &quot;religion&quot;?  What is &quot;an illness&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking on the latter question first, I'm having trouble pinpointing the etymological derivation of &quot;illness&quot;, so I'm hoping you won't object to me picking up a different word: &quot;disease&quot;.  The etymology here is quite evident: dis-, meaning without, and ease.  A discomfort, a difficulty, etc.  When I think about &quot;mental illness&quot; in terms of &quot;disease&quot; in this sense, what comes to me is a question of whether the &quot;illness&quot; is creating distress in someone's life.  For example, the so-called Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (note the similarity between disorder and disease) has, as one major feature (for at least some diagnosed as such) of hyperactivity.  Is hyperactivity a (or does hyperactivity cause) disease?  I think that really depends on the person, and, importantly, on their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a kid in a classroom whose teacher wants everyone still, it's a problem to be hyperactive.  For the same kid out on the playground with the other kids during recess, it might not be, at all.  And for that same kid, grown up, later in life, it may depend a great deal on how they occupy their time: if they're a professional comedian, for example, it might actually be a huge benefit to their chosen occupation.  So, is it a disease?  Well, it might be, if it also causes problems in other areas of their life.  But again, this may be more a function of their environment than some inherent notion that hyperactivity is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;an illness&quot; or something.  If we change &quot;hyperactive&quot; to &quot;energetic&quot;, surely &quot;energetic&quot; is a useful thing in all manner of environments, yes?  And yet, it's probably not the best feature to have while in an opera audience, say.  Or at a funeral.  Or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of context-dependency for questions such as this, which I think too often gets ignored by our society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are &quot;religious people&quot; &quot;ill&quot;, or &quot;diseased&quot;?  I don't know, I think it depends on how you look at it: they probably find &quot;ease&quot; from their religion, when at church, say.  They may have difficulty with it at other times.  Similarly, an atheist may well have a &quot;disease&quot; when surrounded by religious people -- not because they're &quot;ill&quot;, but because they're ill-matched to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the question I would be asking is: given the presumption (which I'm sure many religious people would disagree with) that atheism (and various world views that tend frequently to flow from it) is something more inline with &quot;truth&quot; than religious beliefs, and another presumption (which I think the religious people would mostly agree with) that knowing the &quot;truth&quot; is a useful thing: How can we find ways to cause religion &lt;em&gt;to be&lt;/em&gt; a &quot;dis-ease&quot;, and atheism to &lt;em&gt;not be&lt;/em&gt; one?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that help you answer (or at least have new thoughts regarding) your question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="143" LastActivityDate="2010-12-14T22:52:29.970" CommentCount="4" />

And that seems to be what atheist Buddhists are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I do not believe this is the majority of cases, and that most versions of Buddhism do, if barely, fulfill a majority of the criteria on the checklist and can be considered a religion, for all intents and purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="114" LastEditorUserId="114" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-15T07:32:33.633" LastActivityDate="2010-12-15T07:32:33.633" />

Similarly, I can tolerate people who vote right-wing although I don't, as long as they do not try to convince me to do likewise. And so on and so forth. There is a difficulty in tolerating many religious persuasions; often one of their tenets seem to be intolerance &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.

Many of the most important works of rational thought were done in the vein of religious study, but were as rigorous as any scientific text of their time. Kant and St. Augustine were prolific writers in this regard. The difference might be akin to Mathemeticians viewing all physical sciences as applied science: Atheists are studying pure reason, whereas the religious seek understanding of some intangible through reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of Eastern thought is easily compared to Atheistic views. Buddhism can shun all of its theistic conceptions and still be considered a religion. It may discard the Buddha among the Three Jewels, yet still have meaning from the Dharma (his writings, but here viewed secularly) and the Sangha (the community of people who ascribe to the practices). A definition of religion needn't necessarily include anything supernatural. On the other hand, the Christian concept of religions (which I assume most of us are conditioned to refernce) assumes as much, but as a social construction religions are just a phenomena where a bunch of people all agree to agree on something and derive rituals around that.

Sure, discrimination on religious grounds is illegal and you may be able to sue successfully - but you may also be out of a job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In either situation, be wary of religious &quot;friends.&quot; Atheists sharing their &quot;secret&quot; have often been betrayed by people they hoped would guard that secret.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you're your own person and don't stand to suffer in your life circumstances from a revelation, then it's up to you. Certainly it would be great for atheism for lots of atheists to &quot;come out,&quot; but we don't advocate hurting people needlessly or causing lifelong controversies. On the other hand, if you're a very honest person and the &quot;atheist question&quot; keeps coming up and making things uncomfortable for you, you may find coming out to be a helpful and freeing thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the non-atheist in question is your Significant Other or spouse, you really should get this question out into the open sooner rather than later. The longer a relationship goes on in the shadow of wildly differing opinions about faith the bigger the potential damage later on. Consider a wide range of possible problems with in-laws and with the children you may pan to have.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Coming out to friends is usually OK, especially if they're in no position to destroy your life by snitching. If they're your friends they should be able to accept your views, and you may even help them de-convert. If they go bananas on you, maybe they weren't your friend?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, since it's your belief, you get to pick the label. Here are some considerations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you don't believe in (any) god, you're an &lt;strong&gt;atheist&lt;/strong&gt;. Good for you, but be aware that atheists, under that name, suffer from some horribly bad PR. Now that it's no longer politically correct to espouse hatred for Jews, the Catholic Church's enemy #1 is atheism. The Pope never neglects to throw some bile at us, and other churches and clerics follow suit. As a result of this relentless campaign, &quot;atheist&quot; is a word that incites anger.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chances are you're not 100% sure there is no god, since logic says there's no proof. So you're 99.9% sure? OK, you qualify as an &quot;agnostic atheist,&quot; and the way the word is used these days, you can call yourself an &lt;strong&gt;agnostic&lt;/strong&gt;, even if &quot;agnostic&quot; is more of an adjective than a noun. &quot;Agnostic&quot; doesn't have quite the bad rap that &quot;atheist&quot; does, so if you want to soften the blow while getting the same message across, &quot;agnostic&quot; is the thing to call yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You don't have to label yourself: You can say &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I don't believe&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I've lost my faith&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. That makes you sound like more of a victim than an evildoer, but beware of the well-meaning folks who may then try to &quot;help&quot; you find your faith again!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Atheists sometimes call themselves &lt;strong&gt;freethinkers&lt;/strong&gt;. That sounds nice and positive, but to many folks it also has a Communist ring to it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, a nice positive label is &lt;strong&gt;humanist&lt;/strong&gt; or maybe &lt;strong&gt;secular humanist&lt;/strong&gt;.

(In this case, I'm talking about the 1967 Six Day War...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that this simple statement earned me the label &quot;anti-Semitic Jew&quot; in the early 90's.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Jews had to endure a truly horrific experience during World War II.  And, I suppose, that experience in and of itself is sufficient to justify giving them their long-denied homeland.  But that does not give them the right to commit atrocities towards those who happened to have been in what would become their homeland before the nation was carved out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The news is always the same:  some Palestinian gets fed up at the way his or her people are treated at the hands of the Israelis and commits a terrorist attack.  The Israelis then retaliate on suspected terrorist strongholds or hideouts, often with civilian casualties, which prompts another terrorist attack, which prompts another retaliation and so on and so forth.  It's a vicious cycle or a snowball effect and both sides vilify each other and it's easy to lose sight of who started it...  As if knowing or caring who started it actually matters after this long.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When my kids get into a scuffle, one of them will invariably point to the other and say &quot;he started it.&quot;  As their father, I find myself resorting to the parental cliche of &quot;well, I'm ending it.&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it really that complicated for someone to step in and say &quot;I'm ending it&quot;?

It is a claim about whether or not one thinks the addition of the &quot;God Hypothesis&quot; is a useful/necessary addition to one's worldview.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my answer to the title question is &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;, based on the majority &quot;atheist approved&quot; definition of atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you believe that atheism involves a claim to knowledge, it only means that you have heard or been subject to the dominant non-atheist definition, which essentially boils down to the canard, &quot;Atheists are people who KNOW there is no God.&quot;  I argue that when the religious &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;assert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that atheists stake a claim to knowledge, they do so as a projected mirror image of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THEIR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; untenable position:  Believers claim to KNOW there IS a God.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answering the sub-question: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If &quot;No&quot;, are all claims about the&#xA;  existence of [God] a positive&#xA;  epistemological claim?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned at the top, your second question does not follow from the first, as it is a completely different category of claim/statement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, by distinguishing knowledge claims from belief claims, the answer is &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;.  There can be Gnostic Theists who assert, &quot;I know that my God exists.&quot;  There can be Agnostic Theists who assert, &quot;I believe God exists, but knowledge of the truth of that statement isn't possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the claim to knowledge is not held within the term.  It depends on what the asserter intends.  The phrase &quot;I am an atheist&quot; contains no inherent claim to knowledge, any more than &quot;I am a Theist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="149" LastEditorUserId="149" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-22T14:33:10.080" LastActivityDate="2010-12-22T14:33:10.080" CommentCount="8" />

That includes ideas such as &quot;God is really the universal consciousness that defines all matter,&quot; or &quot;God created the world in a fashion indistinguishable from natural processes, and he does not interfere with his creation. He just exists.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of these possible positions cannot be proved or disproved because a reality in which such claims are true is completely indistinguishable, for us, from a reality in which they are false. It's true that actively denying that such a thing is possible is essentially an act of faith. However, few atheists really have the time or energy to go about actively disbelieving such things, for the very same reasons that these beliefs cannot be confirmed; they just don't matter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more common meaning behind active disbelief in God is best summed as &quot;I believe that there exists no such entity with the attributes assigned to the Judeo Christian God.&quot; That is to say, that there is no omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator entity that interacts with its creation and demands specific behaviors of human beings. That there is no entity who condemns humans to eternal torture unless they profess belief in a  physically embodied manifestation of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This sort of negative belief does not rely on faith, because it bases its claims on ideas that can be demonstrated or logically inferred. They might believe that omniscience is incompatible with free will, and that an entity with both is thus logically impossible, or that evidence indicates that there was no single individual who, 2000 years ago roamed the middle east, gathered disciples, was crucified by a roman governor, and then rose from the dead. These beliefs relate to concrete statements about reality, and so are not necessarily based in faith. They do not deny all possible concepts of God, only specific claims as to the nature and existence of God. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, if you're asking someone why they don't believe in God, make sure you both know what is meant by &quot;God&quot; in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="52" LastActivityDate="2010-12-15T23:24:44.677" />

Most religions tell you to be good (or moral, if you prefer a more scholarly term), and then go on to praise themselves as founts of morality because they encourage being good. The idea that religious people are good, moral, respect-worthy people is pounded into churchgoers with the same kind of relentlessness and universality as the DeBeer's campaign which convinced America that all men must buy their fiancés diamond rings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside the smoke of these doctrines, atheists become aware that religions actually contribute a lot to societal problems. Discrimination against gays is a common problem that hurts up to 10% of society for no reason other than religion; the neglect of medical care in favor of prayer has killed a large number of children, as has religious endorsement of corporal punishment. Christianity's ideas of original sin and eternal hellfire leave scars on the impressionable minds of many other children, and religious sexual repression ironically leads America to lead world statistics for STDs, teen pregnancy and abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some atheists choose not to take a side in the conflict between the secular and the religious, or to espouse the view that everyone is entitled to his own religious views.

A WWII aviator survives a perilous theater in which many of his friends were killed, and instead of counting himself as lucky and/or skilled and the others as unlucky and/or unskilled, pronounces that his god saved him.  The flip side of that, though, is that his god did not save his friends who died.  Why is that?  I don't even know if they think about that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="140" LastActivityDate="2010-12-16T19:00:20.583" />

So when our ancestors observed things moving (stars in the sky, wind in the trees, animals in the bush) they began to attribute &quot;agency&quot; to them, too.  Couple that with a weak understanding of statistics and coincidence (correlation is not causation) and voila, Gods were born.

That &quot;trait&quot; seems to be almost universal in those who identify as atheist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the opposite of credulity and faith:  Believing and accepting everything told to you without asking any questions, and retaining the belief in spite of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example:  A believer's mother dies of cancer at a young age, and he says, &quot;I no longer believe in God... I prayed for a cure, it did not arrive.  I watch pricks get cancer and survive while my mother is killed... there is no Divine justice.

Rather, &quot;spending in the way of Allah&quot; is charity to the poor or in the way of social good, or as is illustrated in hadith (teachings and sayings of the Prophet), can take virtually any positive shape, such as smiling to another person.

And you asked about &quot;atheists&quot;, as a whole, not about me in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to answer the more general question, I'd say, from reading a fair bit of atheist debate, that many atheists define &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt; in the way their majority culture does.

Other atheists, like me, would ask believers to define &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt; in any discussion on the subject. This is useful, because different believers have quite different understandings of God, so it's handy to work out exactly what we're talking about before continuing.

It is only insofar as it does that a believer has any right to seek to suppress it in a pluralistic society (the very same society which provides the believer with the space to make up his own mind about his own beliefs). By threat I don't mean discomfort, or even disgust. I don't mean some vague sense of otherness. I mean an actual threat to life and/or livelihood. That is usually the criteria we use in a just society to justify the suppression of some behaviour. This is usually where believers pull a series of fabricated or dishonest statistics to point to the destructive nature of homosexuality (so they break the rule you set out in your question). But there is simply no evidence they can provide, which holds in the face of examination, that homosexuality can possibly be a threat to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of livelihood, some believers might here argue that since their livelihood is tied in to the suppression of homosexuality, the existence of that homosexuality constitutes a threat. I would counter-argue that if homosexuality did not exist, that believers livelihood would be far more threatened, since he would have to find another target or go out of business altogether. So by being successful in suppressing homosexuality, the anti-gay believer might put himself out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even beyond the suppression of homosexual behaviour, if that were ever even possible, there's the question of whether homosexuality is a behaviour or an identity (or both). Some have made the point for the case where we consider homosexuality an identity; much as I would agree with that, believers argue from the definition of homosexuality as behaviour. But then my original point applies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="122" LastActivityDate="2010-12-20T21:21:20.370" />

The idea that conservative sexual behavior is somehow equivalent to morality is not found in many other cultures. &#xA;I have lived and worked in countries which were very religious and very conservative.

Sex was not spoken about in whispers and was a common topic among people past the age of puberty. &#xA;The only moral issue around sex is informed consent.

There are times that I wonder if this passage is used to teach young children to be ashamed of being naked.  I have two young sons, ages 4 and 6 and I can speak with an absolute certainty that neither one of them is ashamed of being naked.  That, however, may be as much a function of their age than anything.  I do not teach them to be ashamed but that being naked is generally an in-home thing.  And they're fine with that.  I wonder what's going to happen as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are times when I go back and forth between the question of whether it is more important that I identify myself as an atheist or as an antitheist.  The times when I consider myself an antitheist are often the net result of my distaste for the teachings of conservative religions as relates to sex and sexuality.  And it manifests itself in a lot of different ways:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- being opposed to all birth control.  In other words, they want to instill a fear of either pregnancy or disease that causes people, while simultaneously encouraging organic growth of the faith through a large number of births&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- treating gays as second class citizens.  This one makes no sense to me whatsoever.  Depending on how you read the bible, there's anywhere from one to three verses that say not to engage in gay sex.  In the entire bible.  (And for reference, the Bible lists more things that you shouldn't eat and/or more ways by which you shouldn't prepare them.)  Speaking as a straight man who has never felt an attraction for another man, I don't understand why anyone should care one way or another whether someone would prefer to sleep with men or women.  I can understand apathy, but not the antipathy that conservative religions espouse and embrace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- Opposition to the Gardasil vaccine.  Having a vaccine that reduces the risk of cervical cancer will cause girls to sleep around the same way having the typhus vaccine will cause you to want to go to Calcutta to drink the sewer water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-- abstinence pledges.  I think they're a downright bad idea and not a concept to be emulated or encouraged.  I recognize that there aren't many people out there who hold these kinds of pledges to the level of disdain that I do, but I would like to provide more explanation to this statement.  Ask any divorce lawyer the most common reasons why people get divorced, and they'll probably say money first and sex second.  A breakdown in communication stemming from sex generally means that one partner has some sexual need or urge that isn't being satisfied by the other.  Although I'm not trying to say that you should sleep with everyone you meet, how can you possibly know what you do and don't like, sexually, if the first time you do it, is with the person you've promised to spend the rest of your life with?  Sure, it's possible you'll -- forgive the choice of words -- get lucky and find that you and your partner do and don't like the same things, but isn't that an awfully big risk?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I recognize that my disagreement with the official doctrines of the religions that espouse these ideas doesn't implicitly imply atheism, but if you seek to turn away from a religion for any reason, doesn't it make sense to turn away from these doctrines as well?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="205" LastEditorUserId="205" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-22T21:43:30.230" LastActivityDate="2010-12-22T21:43:30.230" CommentCount="1" />

To the former usage, I'd say I'm the obvious ultimate authority. &quot;Love&quot; in this context is a statement of an internal emotion.

According to general theory of relativity, light beams are attracted by the gravitation of the massive celiestial bodies. The light of a distant star, which can be seen near the Sun, changes its direction, and the star looks shifted from its place, when it usually observed at some more distance from the solar disk. This effect can bee seen during the full solar eclipse, when solar light doesn't prevent one to see the stars near the Sun. If during verification the effect wouldn't take place, it's absence would proove the failure of the General theory of relativity, i. e. this kind of experiment, in theory, could have falsified the General theory of relativity. The experience was made by Eddington during solar eclipse at 29th may of 1919 and showed the predicted effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If observations show, that predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is just declined, but &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; falsifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess scientist rarely operate on unverifiable (unfalsifiable) subjects. If there's something that can be either true or wrong, but unfalsifiable — you can neither prove it nor falsify, — there's no practical meaning to &quot;work&quot; on it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, being skeptical (an atheist) is practically justified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="197" LastEditorUserId="197" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-22T18:43:10.193" LastActivityDate="2010-12-22T18:43:10.193" CommentCount="7" />

Knowledge informs the degree to which one will be willing to act on a belief, based on past results/evidence.  In other words Knowledge helps us avoid taking stupid actions based on &quot;mere&quot; belief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting argument and assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Belief is an agreement to a truth claim, which you are then willing to act upon.&#xA;Example from previous conversation, &quot;I believe my wife loves me.  She says so, and as yet has not violated any of the criteria by which I define the word, and so for the day I will stay married (action) and reciprocate my love for her (action).&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Belief (and the action which makes it tangible/real) &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; carries the following characteristic:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are absolutely NO guarantees that your belief will align with results that will occur.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example:  I could hold the belief, &quot;I can jump from this rock to that rock&quot; and then ACT on the belief.  Midair, I truly believe the proposition...i.e., it is a belief.  And yet, having acted says nothing about the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a confirmed belief, but it is provisional: based on the results of the action, in no way guaranteed to recur (no matter how many times it has in the past), and agreed upon by the interpretation of observers who share your terminology.  Knowledge is peer reviewed. (Let's not devolve into a total philosophical hole about whether or not there is any shared reality.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I make the jump from one rock to another, and fall short in the grass, the following becomes true:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I KNOW (provisionally, for this one test) that I can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; jump from one rock to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could CLAIM to know that my belief is true, and that I really CAN jump from one rock to another, but based on the evidence, that would be a claim about a future test... i.e., it's back to being a belief.  (You can hold beliefs even though initial results don't support the belief.  &quot;Try, try again.  You have to &quot;believe&quot; in yourself!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could claim that I DID make the leap, and that therefore I KNOW I can... but this would not hold up to peer review.  Knowledge, while always provisional, requires the ability to survive peer review... otherwise it is a delusion... or an as yet unproven &quot;belief.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, holding onto unproven beliefs amidst a consensus of others whose shared reality suggests &quot;knowledge&quot; that YOUR belief is false, or stubbornly denying that evidence does NOT disprove your belief or at least make it least probable among all possible explanations, is either a delusion or a &quot;religious belief&quot; ... if, per Dawkins, that is not a redundancy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: Another hallmark of religious belief, aside from willingness to hold unfalsifiable beliefs and claiming to KNOW them, is being &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; willing to accept evidentiary claims, without subjecting them to tests, without any personal experience, while ignoring other &quot;knowledge&quot; you already hold that contradict the religious claim (virgin birth, resurrection, miracle cures from water, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="149" LastEditorUserId="149" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-22T19:54:10.880" LastActivityDate="2010-12-22T19:54:10.880" CommentCount="8" />

I don't know if that's possible, because Occam's razor is widely misunderstood and misapplied. The only good refutation is have an adequate understanding of what he meant and how it applies in the eral world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the fancy technical definition of occam's razor, which has two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) &quot;For nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture&quot;. In other words, if you affirm the truth of something, you need to have a good reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) &quot;Plurality should not be assumed without necessity&quot; It means that if you can adequately describe something without making an assumption, then you should exclude the assumption from your description since it clearly adds no useful information. Note that including or excluding the assumption does not make it more or less true, just more concise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occam probably would not have agreed with the statement atheism is a simpler explanation than theism. He was a product of his times and believed his conception of God is the only logically necessary being in the universe. I think that belief now is a little more controversial than it would have been in the 1300s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occam's razor is essentially a rejection of &quot;blind faith&quot; -- you shouldn't believe in something by conviction alone, you need to have a good &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; for your conviction, otherwise you have no claim to knowledge. A good reason starts with logic (ontology) or experience (epistemology).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parsimony&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parsimony means &quot;be frugal in your explanations&quot;. In relation to religion and science, it seems that the universe we have no is fundamentally indistinguishable and consistent with philosophical materialism. It seems odd to talk about the universe with the inclusion of paranormal entities like gods and avatars, parallel spirit universes comprising an after life, etc. The mechanics of the universe are evidently unchanged by the inclusion of these elements (at least in so far as they remain wholly invisible and seem not to interact with the universe), so why bring them up in theories of the universe at all?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, its important to keep in mind that excluding supernatural beings from descriptions of the universe is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same thing as stating that do not or cannot exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanatory power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can trade away simplicity for a gain in explanatory power and accuracy. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The early Ptolemaic picture of the solar system put the earth in the center with all the planets orbiting around in perfect circles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, calculations of planet's actual motion did not match up with predictions from the perfect circle model, a model was created in which planets orbit in small perfect circles and the focal point of the planetary orbit traced perfect circles around the earth. The smaller circle was called the epicycle, and the end result was a much more accurate prediction of planetary motion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, the model with epicycles is only accurate for a very short period of time, after which the margin of inaccuracy grows to the point that epicycles are no longer adequate to explain planetary motion. So, a model was constructed which was epicycles on top of epicycles, which helped, but only temporarily. As inaccuracies are discovered, astronomers attempt to model epicycles on epicyles (up to 60 or 80 circles in circles).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Later observations and predictions by Copernicus abandoned the earth-centered model in favor of a sun-centered model, where planets orbit around the sun in epicycles (on the order about about 20 or 30).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tycho Brahe refined the heliocentric model by providing evidence against &quot;immutable celestial spheres&quot;, he described the motion of comets and supernova which have motions outside and separate from the solar system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kepler went a step further, and while attempting to simplify the epicycles on epicycles theory, he discovered planetary motion could be modeled with ellipses where the sun formed one focal point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what does Occam's razor have to say about this? Well, I'm pretty sure that the move from perfect circles to epicycles to epicycles on epicycles is justified by Occam's razor, not because the explanation kept getting &lt;em&gt;simpler&lt;/em&gt;, but because each refined model because more &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt;. Each explanation could do more than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its really an accident that Kepler's model is &quot;simpler&quot; (however simplicity is measured) than the other models, but had it been incorrect, we'd really have no reason to prefer it over one with infinite epicycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing between explanations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, continuing the line of thought above, let's say that we have two mutually exclusive explanations for an observation. It's not a matter of excluding one explanation because it includes superfluous entities, but really that both explanations account for the same observation in wholly different ways. To use an example, let's take &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Uri Gellar&lt;/a&gt; as an example: he claimed to have paranormal powers which were given to him by extraterrestrials, which ranged from telepathy, telekinesis, and famously the ability to mentally bend spoons and keys from behind a magic cloth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two competing claims: that Uri Gellar really has paranormal powers, or he's using a sleight of hand technique no different than magicians use everyday. Needless to say, Mr Gellar has unable to bend keys in scientific environments, or bend keys behind a cloth when those keys were sitting on a glass table being watched by a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proofs are for math, but [i]accumulation of evidence[/i] is for science. In this case, when testing both theories, evidence in favor of Mr Gellar's actual paranormal powers dwindled in favor of the sleight of hand explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Test First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A handy consequence of Occam's razor is how, if we have to make a choice between testing two competing hypotheses, it seems &quot;simplest&quot; hypothesis is roughly equivalent to the one we can test most quickly. If I had a theory which could be verified in 5 minutes with a two bars of soap and a matchstick, or verified by 100 years of studying theoretical physics and building a massive hadron collider positioned on the moon, any self-respecting scientist will say &quot;use the soap!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we'd be more likely to approach a claim of telepathy by putting two people in separate rooms and attempting to have a sender communicate information to a receiver. We'd be unlikely to approach the situation by scanning the atmosphere for minute perturbations in EMF signals marking the telepathic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theism and Occam's Razor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occam's razor states that, in order to make a claim of theism, that there should be &lt;em&gt;good reasons&lt;/em&gt; to postulate the existence of gods, and that the inclusion of God is a useful contribution to observations we see, and that the inclusion of God provides more accurate explanatory power that non-god explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="318" LastActivityDate="2010-12-22T23:48:09.600" />

One is that it exposes them as callous, evil bastards who don't care for their patients as much as they do their invisible, nonexistent souls.

The Catholic Church believes the doctors should have taken no action and allowed her to die.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second big mistake is that the fraud of the Catholic hospital charade stands exposed.

So some religious people believe in creation over evolution, even though there is some pretty compelling scientific evidence in favor of evolution; and some atheists refuse to believe in concepts like multiverse theory, even if there are compelling mathematical models that support it.  To each of these groups, the new evidence, although compelling to many people, is simply not compelling enough to overcome their existing beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think there are different standards of evidence for all different people, but more important is the relationship between evidence and pre-existing belief.

In fact, religious believers often rely on a &quot;chain of trust&quot;, whereby an authority that they trust will vouch for a &quot;piece of evidence&quot; they say was provided by another authority -- whose supposed works they claim should also be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't to say that skeptics or non-believers do not rely on a similar chain of trust when forming or re-examining their view of the world.

No authority is needed to perform this verification -- all that is needed is a proper application of the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that each link in the skeptic's chain of trust can be independently verified, the chain itself can be disassembled and each link trusted on its own merits. The same is not true of the religious believer's chain.

Instead, in matters of criminal law, as per Article 3 of the &quot;Law of the Source of Law&quot; (one of the six fundamental laws adopted upon ratification of the Lateran Treaty in 1929) the Vatican State generally uses current Italian national law, as well as regional and municipal laws for Rome, as long as they do not conflict with ecclesiastical law or laws specifically promulgated by Pope for the Vatican.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/vatican.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; As a result, the age of consent is the same as that of Italy. Before January 1, 2009, the adoption by the Vatican of changes made by Italy in its laws was automatic. Effective January 1, 2009, the Vatican adoption of changes in Italian law is no longer automatic but comes into effect only after a review.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4BU3BD20081231&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; However, as Italy adopted its present age of consent before January 1, 2009, this change in Vatican policy does not affect the age of consent in Vatican City, which remains the same as that of Italy. &lt;strong&gt;The claim is sometimes found that &quot;In the Vatican State, there is an equal age of consent set at 12 years of age&quot;,&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2008/12/vatican_opposes_un_declaration.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;but this is not correct&lt;/em&gt;. The misunderstanding derives from the fact that Vatican Law follows Italian law. In 1929, when the Lateran Treaty was signed, the age of consent in Italy was 12,&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=cc8nAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; and so the same was true then in Vatican City. However, since that time the Italian law has been changed, and so the laws of Vatican City (in accordance with the policy that was in place until January 1, 2009) changed automatically with them.&lt;/strong&gt; Since there has been no change in the Italian age of consent since January 1, 2009, the two remain identical with no further review by the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Age of consent in Italy is 14, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_Europe#Italy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;according to the same article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27" LastEditorUserId="27" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-23T10:43:53.550" LastActivityDate="2010-12-23T10:43:53.550" />

I eventually allowed myself this tactic, when I could not reconcile inconsistent dogma, practice or attitudes.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different questions for different folks, but here are a couple that really got the ball of non-belief rolling when I was still a believer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What If the bible isn't verbatim dictated by God?  What would I have to reconsider? What parts of the world would suddenly collapse?&#xA;What If I am the only person in my life capable of discerning &quot;God's Will&quot; for me... even if I consult a mentor, or the bible... I ultimately am the ONLY one deciding?  What if there IS no God's will for me, and it's all just me making choices?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Seek Consistent thought:&lt;/strong&gt;  The believer (all of us, for that matter) need to pay attention when something just doesn't seem right.  Play with the niggling doubts you run into.  Seek consistency across your whole worldview, and when you find yourself saying something like &quot;I can't continue pursuing this thought, because it violates my faith,&quot; the believer has to be comfortable asking the &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;What If&quot; questions... Why can't this area be made consistent? Says who?  Why are they saying it?  What &quot;would be&quot; the consistent position here?  Why would that be bad?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  You're not alone:&lt;/strong&gt;  It's a lot less difficult in the internet age, but at the time I was &quot;de-converting&quot; I had the pervasive sense that I might be the first person who had ever left his faith. :-)  I exaggerate, but the believer will think they are alone, and they might even be told by family that they will be abandoned.  Don't sweat it. That kind of emotional blackmail is indicative of a bad reason to stay in any group/mindset.  Let your friend know there are LOTS of good places to turn for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  It Gets Better.&lt;/strong&gt;  (with a tip of the hat to Dan Savage's &quot;It Gets Better&quot; campaign). Based on my experiences, it was a tough couple of years of re-structuring my thinking before I truly got comfortable with the implications of atheism.  It is because a believer must uproot foundations of their former model of thought.  Tell your friend don't be afraid...talk, ask questions, keep thinking.  The world will go on, and you WILL eventually realize that the fear you are feeling NOW, on the cusp of leaving beliefs behind, evaporates over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Ya Gotta Want It:&lt;/strong&gt;  The believer, implicitly or explicitly, is asking &quot;Why would I WANT to give up my lifelong friend, spiritual comfort, community?&quot;  If you can help them see that &quot;our way of life&quot; is desirable, enjoyable, fulfilling, sufficient, that will help them loosen the grip on the thing they perceive as their life raft. (Another useful analogy, to help YOUR approach, is to recognize that a life-long believer is in some ways like an abused spouse.  The psychology of staying with an abuser is deep, but at its core is the assumption, &quot;The devil I know is better than the devil I don't.&quot; We MUST help someone seeking escape see that there are better alternatives out here.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.  Share some ridicule and laughter:&lt;/strong&gt; This one I have only recently come to consider valuable.  A well done, insightful, non-attacking bit of comedy can really quickly establish the &quot;dissonance&quot; that is the motivation for someone to re-consider deeply held beliefs.  Use your judgment, but I have found a bunch of Tim Minchin's satirical songs to be wickedly funny and they expose some core faith ideas to appropriate ridicule.  Germane to my &quot;What if the Bible isn't dictated by God?&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxXrTRFVUkQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I recommend Tim's &quot;The Good Book.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  Apologies to any pants-wetting caused. :-)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.  It's their journey.&lt;/strong&gt; , if asked your opinion on specific, difficult issues that the person is currently trying to navigate, give your perspective while avoiding an attack on the belief system or Religion as a whole.  They have to understand that it is their journey and choice to change. If they ultimately want to, it will be their choice, not because you rammed arguments down their throat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matter of fact explanations, &quot;Well, this is why XYZ doesn't seem to make sense to me...&quot; will help, without setting off the deeply ingrained, heavily evolved defense mechanisms embedded in most religions. The defense mechanisms of this virus are deeply rooted... partially in total demands to give one's life to the faith, and partially in self-containing circular logic evolved to keep the flock from noticing there are significant gaps in the fence.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be &quot;fishers of men,&quot; then you don't want to scare the fish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="149" LastEditorUserId="149" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-23T16:11:21.633" LastActivityDate="2010-12-23T16:11:21.633" CommentCount="10" />

You're effectively saying that everything that can possibly be done has been done, and all that's left is to wait until the outcome comes out.

There are no secular explanations for how it differs in any way, shape, or form from consentual heterosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until you get an answer, which you won't, you really need to hammer on the point that people who disapprove of homosexuality don't have rational reasons for doing so.

Errm. Preaching safe sex and condom use does an infinite amount more than preaching against homosexuality. Now, why is homosexuality immoral?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;They molest children!&quot; -- you ever listen to actual things pedophiles say? Ever attempted to find a member of the community and listen to them? Understand their motives?  &quot;Offenders attracted to boy victims typically report that they are uninterested in or revulsed by adult homosexual relationships and find the young boy's &lt;em&gt;feminine characteristics&lt;/em&gt; ... appealing&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gayscience.html#myths&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). The study continues &quot;pedophiles that were attracted to both children and adults (51%), 83% were exclusively heterosexuals, and 17% were bisexual.  [...] In yet another study at the Children's Hospital in San Diego, of the 140 boys presenting with sexual abuse, &lt;em&gt;only 4% of the assaults were by homosexuals&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Remember, for decades, there has been a stigma against gays, and there has been a tendency to categorize male-on-male abuse as homosexual without assessing the offenders actual sexual orientation. An overwhelming majority of sex offenders and pedophiles are heterosexual men, and attraction to children is a paraphilia that is otherwise separate from a person's sexual orientation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The list of reasons goes on and on and on, and every one of them will avoid addressing how or why homosexuality is immoral.

I'm sure being infinitely intelligent and having access to all moral philosophy past, present, future, and otherwise, if he thinks its immoral, he could just -- and I hope this isn't too much to ask -- tell us why.

The argument against homosexuality is as simple as this: two dudes kissing is totally super gross!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They find it gross, disgusting, and they extremely uncomfortable with the subject.

In my experience, this is no easy task given the defense mechanisms that religion embeds upon it's adherents, often starting from a very early age.  It's important to recognize that you're unlikely to make highly religious people give up their beliefs, identities and rituals so your goals should be modest.  Sure, helping a theist become an atheist would be wonderful but just empowering a believer with stronger critical thinking skills is what ought to matter most.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To do so, you should be mindful of who you choose to influence.  I think this is even more important than the methods employed.  There are some who are incredibly stubborn, unreflective and deficient when it comes to objective thinking.  In my experience, the people worth influencing need to be fairly intelligent and it helps if they're educated.  Those with a liberal arts education have a background that provides a basis in critical analysis while those with a science education should have a firm grasp of objectivity and the scientific method.  People need to learn the value of truth, seeing diverse perspectives, as well as the merits of logic and the basic fallacies.  Of course, these kinds of backgrounds aren't essential but they do provide a good leg up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Critical thinking skills can be discussed without getting into religion.  While there are some who are willing to debate and/or listen to arguments and prescriptions for skepticism, most theists avoid such challenges.  I know several who despised the likes of Dawkins and Harris and would immediately tune out of anything they had to say.  Over time, you can eventually lure them back into the debate but it takes some philosophical building blocks and subtle chipping away at the defenses to do so.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's uncomfortable for someone to hear ideological advice from a peer. Fortunately, there is plenty of media that can challenge a believer's defenses without ruining a relationship.  The media spectrum ranges from gentle messages to in-your-face confrontation.  Movies, books, television, blogs and music can illustrate the diversity of ideology, sympathy for different viewpoints, as well as the immorality of dogma and prejudice.  For those who have a sense of humour, one of the best chisels is comedy.  Atheist comedians, such as George Carlin, Ricky Gervais and Bill Maher, may be blunt but the hilarity of absurdity is hard for even strong theists to resist.  Exposure to the right types of media can plant seeds of doubt in the minds of believers and shape tolerance for different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I expect that a typical theist won't lose his/her religion on account of such media but he/she will likely face cognitive dissonance on some level.  That is key to bringing the theist into a reality where he/she is able to question beliefs.  Once a believer is willing to accept internal challenges, doors are open for conversation or even argumentation that can alter his/her preconceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="112" LastActivityDate="2010-12-23T18:04:52.610" CommentCount="1" />

It would suggest that a tendency to accept appeals to authority as justifications for belief is fairly universal. While the epistemologists present might bristle at this claim, I do think appeals to authority can be reasonable at least for functional belief for the purpose of guides behavior. For one example that shows my hand a bit, not all of us can be climate scientists but that doesn't mean that we should not believe in global warming and adjust our behavior accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, then the difference lies in which domains individuals are willing to accept appeals to authority rather than a simple rejection thereof. Importantly, one of the nice things about empirical observation is that experiments, at least &lt;em&gt;ideally&lt;/em&gt;, are repeatable and observable by outside parties. These properties generally are not present in many religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still though, it may be that atheists end up having more veritable belief systems, by virtue of their appealing exclusively to scientific claims, but that does not mean that they require a &lt;strong&gt;different level or type&lt;/strong&gt; of evidence. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; would require a deeper understanding of the positive qualities of science. And while many atheists may have such understanding, we cannot yet prove that all of them do or even that a majority do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An efficient and functionally useful heuristic of that true understanding is to simply state that if a scientist says it, then the statement is probably true, and if an explanation appeals to supernatural forces, then it is probably false prima facie, and is the result of a testable relation between the phenomenon in question that simply hasn't yet been discovered. If people can get by on this, and scientists are trustworthy enough to keep check on each other's credibility (which the peer review system helps enforce) then this heuristic will be pretty solid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="404" LastActivityDate="2010-12-23T19:28:23.273" CommentCount="4" />

Then, if they wish to appeal to simplicity and simplicity alone, they must accept this new theism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that a proper extension is not just it is the simplest explanation that fits the data, but that its the simplest explanation that predicts the data, and actively &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; predict data that does not occur. This seems a more precise and effective definition of Ockham's razor that would allow us to both rule out the above argument, and to rule out the standard theist's argument, since rarely do belief systems make positive and negative predictions about the world that end up being upheld.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="404" LastActivityDate="2010-12-23T20:33:16.000" />

I realize this discussion may take things slightly off topic so I will start a new post, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think this is an issue relevant to the definition of atheism, since it depends largely on whether atheism is purely a statement of belief or knowledge or whether it is merely a doctrine as in 2b).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The American Atheists define it as such:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;What is atheism?&quot; is usually the one&#xA;  question never asked of most atheists.&#xA;  Most people do not ask this question&#xA;  because they already have their own&#xA;  ideas about what atheism is and what&#xA;  atheists are. Where these ideas&#xA;  originate vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Older dictionaries define atheism as&#xA;  &quot;a belief that there is no God&quot; and/or&#xA;  &quot;denial of God.&quot; Some dictionaries go&#xA;  further and say that atheism is&#xA;  &quot;wickedness,&quot; &quot;sinfulness,&quot;&#xA;  &quot;heathenism,&quot; &quot;paganism,&quot; and&#xA;  &quot;immorality.&quot; Some dictionaries even&#xA;  say that atheism is the &quot;doctrine that&#xA;  there is no God.&quot; At least The&#xA;  American Heritage ® Dictionary says&#xA;  &quot;God and gods&quot; after the word&#xA;  &quot;doctrine,&quot; but that does not detract&#xA;  from the fact that use of the word&#xA;  doctrine is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The fact that the dictionary's&#xA;  definition uses the phrase &quot;there is&#xA;  no God&quot; betrays the theistic influence&#xA;  in defining the word atheism. If&#xA;  dictionaries did not contain such&#xA;  influence, then the definition would&#xA;  read, &quot;A belief that there are no&#xA;  gods.&quot; The use of god in singular&#xA;  form, with a capital G, is indicative&#xA;  of Christian influence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, using words like&#xA;  &quot;doctrine&quot; and &quot;denial&quot; betray the&#xA;  negativity seen of atheists by&#xA;  theistic writers. Atheism does not&#xA;  have a doctrine at all and atheists&#xA;  certainly do not &quot;deny&quot; that gods&#xA;  exist. Denial is the &quot;refusal to&#xA;  believe.&quot; Atheism does not &quot;know there&#xA;  is a god but refuse to believe in him&quot;&#xA;  (or her). That would be like saying&#xA;  that you know Big Foot exists but you&#xA;  refuse to believe in him. If the&#xA;  evidence of gods was insurmountable&#xA;  and provable, and atheists still&#xA;  refused to believe, then that would be&#xA;  an act of denial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the original meaning, the&#xA;  word atheism comes from the Greek&#xA;  atheos, which means &quot;without god.&quot; The&#xA;  original meaning of the word, based on&#xA;  its Greek origins, mentions nothing&#xA;  about &quot;disbelief&quot; or &quot;denial.&quot; A short&#xA;  and single-word definition would be&#xA;  &quot;godless.&quot;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atheists.org/atheism/about_atheism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an international organization, but it seems that the definition the AA prefer is &quot;godless&quot;.

Combine this with a human's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Confimation Bias&lt;/a&gt; and it's easy to see how any human without an education in the scientific method will naturally come to supernatural explanations for natural events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't weaken the atheists' position at all though. The entire scientific method is built in such a way to overcome these natural biases. Using the method people have come to explain natural phenomena using natural explanations reducing the need for deities, gods, or other agencies to describe the natural world. The opposite has never been true, we have never come to a supernatural explanation through observation and study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To your original question: should the 'natural' belief in the supernatural matter to atheists. No, with one footnote: if a supernatural belief is used to hinder the progress of science and education, then we should absolutely care.

If you allow any possible representation relation (I won't even limit it to functions) then it would seem to be impossible to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; find the KJ bible, and every other type of bible and work of fiction in a subset of the digits of almost any transcendental number. Additionally, if i simply had the function 17 = &quot;the words in the book called the bible&quot;, the number 17 &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; technically a mathematical constant, and using my code, the bible is properly encoded within. The point of 2) is that the code is not constrained, giving insane degrees of freedom for this to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Even if we figure out how to restrict the coding scheme, is there a particular human language that you would expect it to be written in? If not, that gives equally problematic massive degrees of freedom, since you could then create a language for the express purpose of having the bible in these digits simply transformed once given a code.

Humans evolved using a &quot;tribal&quot; strategy (as did many other species) where we MUST rely on others to survive.

When we make a conclusion, we can to some extent &quot;trace&quot; what this conclusion is based on, and how high our confidence level is about it. Reasoning is then the process of drawing new conclusions from existing ones, and evaluating one's confidence level about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This process is not really like the mathematical logic in my opinion, because facts are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; known with absolute certainty. It's always about probabilities. If you trace your conclusions all the way to their origin you will invariably find that your senses are the ultimate source. We usually place a very high degree of trust into them, taking what we perceive for a fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people are good at drawing logically sensible conclusions and confidence levels in this imperfect-information &quot;game&quot;, while others are really bad at it. At one extreme is not noticing fundamental flaws like circular reasoning, or massively mis-assigning confidence levels, or taking a conclusion as a 100% certain fact instead of evaluating it properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, even people who don't make such basic mistakes are still drawing conclusions with imperfect information, from &quot;probabilistic facts&quot; whose probability of being true they can only estimate very approximately. I don't think there's a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; way to make these conclusions in the absense of an accurate probability measure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what I'm getting at is that this is a spectrum. We have propositions in our brains in which we have a certain degree of confidence. We casually classify them as knowledge or belief based on the degree of confidence we have in the reasoning chain that led to a particular proposition. If you reckon the reasoning chain is massively flawed, but a person has a high degree of confidence in the result, you casually call it &quot;belief&quot;. If you think the chain is not too far off, you call it &quot;knowledge&quot;. Postmodernist philosophers might still call it &quot;belief&quot; though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I think I'll compare it with &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;. The terms are convenient, even though there is no qualitative difference between them; the line between them is arbitrary and undefined, and they are relative to the context in which they are discussed. For example, sun's corona is &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; compared to its core, but &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; compared to snow - just like the existence of dark matter is a &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to the existence of gravity, but &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; in comparison to the existence of god.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="89" LastEditorUserId="89" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-28T15:59:22.453" LastActivityDate="2010-12-28T15:59:22.453" CommentCount="2" />

However, this does assume that people apply their logical thought to their beliefs which is probably not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had to look up the word 'reprobate' and got the following definitions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a depraved, unprincipled, or wicked person - this doesn't apply to most atheists, as it does not apply to most people in general&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a person rejected by God and beyond hope of salvation - this does not apply to atheists; they reject all gods. There is no way for something that does not exist to reject anything.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the 'grace required to believe and have faith'; most atheists have beliefs and a lot of them have strong beliefs. They have beliefs in politics, philosophy and ethics. Most atheists don't have faith. Faith simply means 'belief that is not based on evidence'.

'I had pasta for dinner', however extraordinary claims such as 'a magical being created the world and spoke to me' require extraordinary evidence, which can not be provided by personal experience.

The definition of an atheist precludes you from believing in God. Interestingly though, if a creed is merely a statement of belief, then for those whose atheism means &quot;Person X believes that no god exists,&quot; that is technically a belief. Not all atheists take that form of atheism to be their own (some, e.g. Rob Schneider on this website would argue that atheism is having a &quot;lack of belief in God&quot;), but all atheists who do take the stronger form of active belief do have a creed, their atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the question raised in the text, I think you could turn to Dawkin's &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0618056734&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Unweaving the Rainbow&lt;/a&gt; if you wanted a thorough treatment of this issue (though he doesn't exclusively talk about this sort of thing within it, how to find purpose in our existences is a running them).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another argument about morality and how it should be rooted in science is Harris' &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1439171211&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Moral Landscape&lt;/a&gt;. I haven't read it so I can't speak to anything within, but I have heard, on average, fairly positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still there is the question of whether our philosophies and creeds actually do anything to affect our behavior, which hasn't been super verified in research. For example, in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/darley_samarit.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Good Samaritan study&lt;/a&gt; they had subjects who were training to be seminaries and normal people pass by someone who was in clear need of help(slumped in a corner of an alley way moaning). These participants behavior did not vary based on their seminarian status, but whether they were hurried or not made a huge impact on their stopping to help.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Still it is unclear what relationship moral beliefs has on moral behavior, one paper that explores an intermediate hypothesis and also nicely reviews the past research (as is available for free &lt;a href=&quot;http://cognition.berkeley.edu/Publications_files/Lombrozo-CogSci-2009.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;) is Lombrozo's &quot;The role of moral commitments in moral judgment&quot;.( 2009, &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Science&lt;/em&gt;, 33, 273-286.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the degree to which answers to your question matter is dependent on the relationship that Lombrozo explores. If it turns out that these attitudes do not majorly affect behavior, it seems a pretty irrelevant question (to me at least) what atheists actually believe, but rather their behavior should be investigated on its own. Now I doubt that that strong hypothesis will end up being true especially given Haidt's work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/mft/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;foundations of morality&lt;/a&gt; differing between political leanings.

Additionally, it de-legitimizes god-ordained social rules such as the belief that women are inferior to or must serve men, eliminates caste systems that divide people in social classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theism&lt;/strong&gt;: keeping in mind the great chain of being, beasts &amp;lt; humans &amp;lt; angels &amp;lt; god.

That might be why you weren't able to find a lot of information online on how to respond to this kind of argument.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with the argument, TAG is an argument that tries to prove the existence of God by demonstrating that Christianity can account for logic but that naturalism can't. In other words, TAG tries to prove that Christianity a better explanation for how the universe behaves than naturalism can and thus that atheists should convert to Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's usually presented like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_identity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;law of identity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_non-contradiction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;law of non-contradiction&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;law of excluded middles&lt;/a&gt;, exist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes are absolutely true.&lt;/strong&gt; They are not subjectively true; that is, they are not sometimes true and sometimes false, depending on preference or situation.  Otherwise, they would not be absolute. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes form the basis of rational discourse.&lt;/strong&gt; If the logical absolutes are not absolute, then truth cannot be known and no rational discourse can occur. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes are transcendent.&lt;/strong&gt; That is, they are not dependent on space, time, or human minds. They remain true, no matter where or when you are. They remain true, even if humans cease to exist or no matter what humans believe. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes are not dependent on the material world.&lt;/strong&gt; They are not found in atoms, motion, heat, or under rocks. Nor can they be be photographed, frozen, weighed, or measured. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes are conceptual (of the mind) by nature.&lt;/strong&gt; Logic is a process of the mind.  Logical absolutes provide the framework for logical thought processes.  Therefore, logical absolutes are conceptual by nature. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A person's thoughts reflect what he or she is. Absolutely perfect thoughts reflect an absolutely perfect mind.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical absolutes must then reflect a transcendent, absolute, perfect, and independent mind,&lt;/strong&gt; as they are transcendent, absolute, are perfectly consistent, and are independent of the universe. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We call this transcendent, absolute, perfect, and independent mind God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above is the short version of Matt Slick's presentation of TAG, which is the version I have come across the most often. The full version can be read &lt;a href=&quot;http://carm.org/transcendental-argument&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Refuting TAG &lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to refute TAG. Below are the counterarguments that I find the most persuasive. It's not an exhaustive list, by any means. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Point out that they're in deeper trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A common answer, by atheists, to TAG is that no one needs to account for the laws of logic. They are just this way, for no reason with no cause. It's just the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of TAG will argue that &quot;Simply saying they exist is not an answer.&quot; However, adopting such a position is a dangerous one for a theist as this position has dramatic consequences for him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to Christians, God has the attributes he has for no reason with no cause. If God's attributes were this way for a particular reason, it would imply the existence of another consciousness capable of modifying the attributes of God and that is not what they believe. Therefore, God's attributes are just this way, for no reason with no cause. It's just the way they are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It directly follows from that that logical absolutes are just this way, for no reason with no cause, because they are part of God's attributes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Christian ends up at the same place as the atheist in regards to logical absolutes - they just are the way they are - and he has to account for the existence of God on top of it. He'll likely try to argue he doesn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to account for the existence of God, at which point you can tell don't have to account for the existence of logical absolutes if he doesn't account for the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Correcting their understanding of logic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A poor understanding of logic is at the foundation of TAG. First of all, the phrase &quot;logical absolute&quot; is not used in academia. In fact, if you google it you'll notice that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the results are about TAG. That's because it's a phrase made up by apologists to help their rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The real term to described what they call a logical absolute is a law of logic.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proponents of TAG believe, or try to persuade others that, laws of logic are prescriptive. That's false; they are descriptive. That is, the laws of logic don't tell the Universe how to behave but rather describe, to us, how the Universe behaves. In other words, the laws of logic are mere explanations of how certain aspects of the Universe behave and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is why you don't need to give an account for them: they exist only in our own minds, as we created them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;God is subject to the laws of logic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can try to ask the theist if he believes that God can create a logically impossible object, like a square circle. If he does answer no, then you can point out that he too has to account for logical absolutes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A common counterargument to that argument is that God cannot behave in a way that is not consistent to his own nature. However, that is demonstrably false: if God created imperfect creatures (ie humans) even though He is perfect then He should be able to create a square circle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Fallacy of Composition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The argument that &quot;A person's thoughts reflect what he or she is&quot; is fallacious. More precisely, it's a fallacy of composition. It is not because something is true of some part of the whole that it's necessarily true about the whole. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition#Example&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia's example&lt;/a&gt; for this fallacy is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Atoms are not visible to the naked eye&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Humans are made up of atoms&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, humans are not visible to the naked eye.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By that logic, only a citrusy and liquid mind could conceive of orange juice. Needless to say, that's absurd. Humans minds can think of orange juice despite not being citrusy nor liquid. Likewise, human minds can conceive logical absolutes despite not being transcendent, absolute, or perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="484" LastActivityDate="2010-12-27T09:25:46.863" />

I'm not sure if you assumed this, but karma is not a concept where &quot;you assume that there is someone/something keeping track of the current score of your actions&quot;.

Karmas are attracted to the karmic&#xA;  field of a soul on account of&#xA;  vibrations created by activities of&#xA;  mind, speech, and body as well as on&#xA;  account of various mental&#xA;  dispositions. Hence the karmas are the&#xA;  subtle matter surrounding the&#xA;  consciousness of a soul. When these&#xA;  two components, i.e. consciousness and&#xA;  karma, interact, we experience the&#xA;  life we know at present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you strip away the metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and look at this as a psychological projection of the phrase you reap what you sow, it's is easy to understand the subtlety of Karma and how it does not need to rely on any god or supernatural concept in order to give one a sense of the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Karma is not some cosmic piggy bank of good = good, when reduced to that it is a bastardization of it's millenias-old meaning. In this form, it is not an idea or worldview that can be gamed or exploited, as such it is not something that adds to how to understand the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Karma in its truer-to-form framing, it is a shared understanding of the world, indigenous to the East, that is a projection of the reciprocity of one's actions. That's it. Reap what you sow. Basically, the choices you have in front of you are the outcome of the choices you have made in the past. There is no itemization to specific actions, but rather it must be construed as a gestault. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last, on a psychological &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Since the 20th century emergence of&#xA;  emotional intelligence as a novel&#xA;  paradigm for viewing human experience,&#xA;  karma has become a sectarian term&#xA;  which umbrellas the entire collection&#xA;  (both conscious and subconscious) of&#xA;  human emotionality.[41] This modern&#xA;  view of karma, devoid of any spiritual&#xA;  exigencies, obviates the need for an&#xA;  acceptance of reincarnation in&#xA;  Judeochristian societies and attempts&#xA;  to portray karma as a universal&#xA;  psychological phenomenon which behaves&#xA;  predictably, like other physical&#xA;  forces such as gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note: If someone wants to add in reincarnation, they do make it a supernatural concept.

If he could not, he would have to buy 100 copies of my new book, &lt;em&gt;The Broken American Male&lt;/em&gt;. A few days later Hitchens sent an email to the 92nd St. Y, who hosted the debate, citing Israeli writer Dr. Israel Shahak's book, &lt;em&gt;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&lt;/em&gt;, as his source, and asking that his email be circulated to the debate's vast audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I quickly wrote back that Shahak's 1965 claim to have witnessed an Orthodox man refusing to allow his telephone to be used to call an ambulance for a non-Jew because it would violate Shabbat, and to have had a &quot;rabbinical court in Jerusalem&quot; confirm that the man had acted properly, was exposed as a fraud a year later by Lord Immanuel Jakobovitz, later to become the universally venerated Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth. Jakobovitz wrote in &lt;em&gt;Tradition&lt;/em&gt; in 1966: &quot;Dr. Shahak, challenged to substantiate his personal 'testimony' was eventually forced to admit that the Orthodox Jew he had 'witnessed' refusing the use of his telephone simply did not exist. The whole incident had been fabricated in true &lt;em&gt;Protocols&lt;/em&gt; style. Equally overlooked was the circumstance that the Rabbinate, far from having confirmed Dr. Shahak's allegation, had in fact ruled that the Sabbath must be violated to save non-Jewish no less than Jewish lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I asked Hitchens to now go back to the well and find a non-fraudulent source. And since his book cited &quot;many&quot; Jewish courts that had so ruled, surely it would be easy. I told him that I was happy to forgo the buying of 100 copies of my book in exchange for a simple correction of the defamatory error. To his great credit, Hitchens wrote back that it was &quot;very good of you to put it like that: I will certainly undertake to correct anything in my book that doesn't survive a challenge.... Shahak was a friend of mine and it's his honor that is posthumously at stake, not mine (or OK, as well as mine).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After the exchange of several more emails, Hitchens wrote with a link to a column that in turn cited the controversial &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; piece of July, 22, 2007, by my close friend Prof. Noah Feldman of Harvard, in which a Jewish teacher in his day school mentioned the existence of religious sources that would distinguish between a Jewish and non-Jewish life on the Sabbath. The column, however, conceded that these are minority opinions which are not authoritative and which have been overruled throughout Jewish history by Jewish courts who have never wavered from the ruling that Jews must save non-Jewish lives on all occasions and on the Sabbath. Based on this, and being unable to find a single court to back up his serious libel against Judaism, Hitchens wrote, &quot;I would consider changing religious courts to fundamentalist rabbinical authorities.&quot; And that's where it now stands, with Hitchens agreeing to do the honorable thing and amend the slur in his book, which I trust he will implement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="484" LastEditorUserId="484" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-12-28T19:19:14.013" LastActivityDate="2010-12-28T19:19:14.013" CommentCount="3" />

They have a history, and that history undoubtedly was religious. Moreover, religiosity is centered on the belief of things without clear evidence for it. The removal of this would require the absence of an uninformed underclass. Even if this society is powered by Robots and wants for nothing, this wouldn't REMOVE these people. It would perhaps do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So a society that is simply without a religious underpinning is simply not realistic. It is like a society where everyone works firing cannon at an enemy. While metaphorical, it ignores the fact that someone must feed these people, and grow that food, and weave the cloth, and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as for the idea that one cannot be religious about science-fact. This is patently preposterous. It is only due to our recently crawling out of the primordial societal soup that our religions are all magical. What makes them religion is that the followers of it simply believe what they are told. If I were answering the Question's Title, and not the Question itself. I could get away with not addressing this. But &quot;Without the bounds of religions&quot; is the problem here. Any belief system that has people who believe it because everyone else believes it, is religious in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religion is not a blanket term you apply to magic. In fact, non-conformist beliefs around magic can be both atheistic and non-religious. Religion is all about a group of people who believe in a set of beliefs and customs, and normally without questioning the authority that espouses those beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;END EDIT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally. Religion was a major driving force in the development of our own society. Possibly one of many factors that lead to our success. It enables people with different motives to work together for a common goal. And when you view a society as an evolving organism, the religious ones tend to dominate the secular.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This points heavily towards any society, human or otherwise, having some kind of religious faction. Until said society is able to eliminate the less intelligent among them, which is one of the facets of the few attempts in our own history that we most find distasteful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that some form of religiosity will continue to be with us for a very long time. It might be a religious belief in whatever science has to say. But it will be a religious belief none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember. What breaks a reasoning person away from being a religious one is not what he believes, rather how he came by those beliefs. There will always be people that follow.

This is not something anyone can prove; they simply are not permitted within a materialist's world view. This is undeniably and inherently vicious and circular: you're essentially claiming you don't believe non-material things can be known through a non-material method of knowing, because you would deny such method of knowing. This breaks down the topic into a few statements, which the burden will be on you to defend:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Materialism is the only/most reasonable way of knowing. (as said, requires reason)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not-rational to assume something exists without material evidence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That existence and non-existence is not 50/50. (requires reason)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of these should require much explanation. If you can convince someone that materialism is a better world view then God is excluded. Now we address the whooper:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What would make the statement, &quot;I know something does not exist&quot; true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that knowing something does not exist must be differentiated from, &lt;em&gt;&quot;I believe something does not exist&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. And, in that you'll find the light at the end of the tunnel. Either,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I know something does not exist&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;is invalid.

I'll make the bold claim that this addendum is also implicit when this claim is made by any sane person -- including whomever I'm speaking to.

In such circumstances it is perfectly reasonable to take the absence of proof of its occurrence as positive proof of its non-occurrence.&quot; - Introduction to Logic, Copi, 1953, Page 95&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia further goes on to use &lt;em&gt;I know there is no change in my pocket,&lt;/em&gt; as a practical example of this non-violation of the &quot;evidence of absence&quot; fallacy. I could expand on this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I believe that conscious aliens do not exist in our solar system.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I know that conscious aliens do not exist in our solar system.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would maintain the former has been exhausted... We can affirmatively state the later. As far a materialist can know or not know, we know conscious aliens do not exist in our solar system. The stance that the subject is not there is the only sane and rational one if you're a materialist with no further evidence, no evidence to the contrary, and no further experiments you could perform within reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are the same assumptions you would make to some claims in the affirmative:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I know evolution exists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I know gravity is a natural phenomena.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Know&quot; might be picking up a new meaning when you're affirming the negative, but it should be polysemously expanded to encompass that for materialists.

Even though God has given every man intelligence and an ability to distinguish right from wrong, man has chosen to do wrong. The consequences are devastating. Sin brings death and destruction, and finally Hell. God never intended for it to be that way, but he gave man the ability to choose to disobey. I'm not sure we could have a meaningful relationship with Him otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We like to blame God for the bad things that happen. &quot;Why did God allow such and such,&quot; &quot;how could he be so cruel?&quot; Ultimately, every bad thing we see happen is the result of sin. Perhaps not directly the sin of the passengers on the plane that crashes, but sin is at the root nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sin is the root cause of all of man's woes, and all sin can be traced back to the Garden where the first man chose to disobey God. Before that sin, we see what God truly intended for man. Unbroken fellowship with God, freedom from sin and its curse--death. Blaming God for the tragedy in the world is like blaming GM when a drunk drives a Cadillac into a crowd of padestrians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered&#xA;  into the world, and death by sin; and&#xA;  so death passed upon all men, for that&#xA;  all have sinned: Romans 5:12&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die. Ezekiel 18:4&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to God's goodness, that is often misunderstood. If a guilty rapist and murderer was brought before a judge after having been found guilty, then asked the judge, &quot;Your honor, I know I'm guilty, but I know you are a good judge and so you'll let me off the hook.&quot; No, if that is a good judge, he'll put that guy away for life or give him the death sentence. God giving man the just consequences of his sins is proof His goodness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit - addressing knowing / unknowing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question is more toward how can believers claim to know God's will and yet not have an answer to explain certain things, I guess I don't see the conflict. God does offer knowledge to those that seek Him in His word:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Psa 119:130  The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, believers don't really spend the time seeking God that would help them understand things. But, there will always be details that we cannot explain. This is true for the atheist/evolutionist also. I just watched an episode of Nature where they confessed that scientist have no idea how certain Canadian area turtles are able to freeze completely and thaw without dying. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So while a Christian can know a great deal of what God's will is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine John 7:17&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;God never said He'd explain every detail of life.

Although it's not the ideal response to this argument, incompetent design holds that if life was designed, then the designer certainly didn't do it intelligently.  Ironically, some of the places in life that are so often trumped up as evidence for design (the &quot;thumb&quot; of a panda or the human eye come to mind) are &quot;designed&quot; so poorly, that it causes one to question the intelligence of the so-called designer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Theists often counter this argument by pointing to the book of Job in the bible.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with this book, Job was an extremely pious, devout, &quot;god-fearing&quot; man.  And god and satan are talking about things and satan kind of challenges god for the right destroy his life.  And so god lets satan do so.  A test of Job's faith, of course.

Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, god essentially gets the right to claim a higher &quot;right&quot; of judgment because he and only he created the universe, so who are we to question why he does things?

Where do you go from there?  It's emotionally unsatisfying, weak, and, if you're ever involved in a discussion or a debate with a theist who ends up resorting to that line, it's pointless to continue.

Occasionally I will bring up topics stating that they have been recently bothering me, e.g. problems of free will, the church's exclusion of women in leadership positions (my family is Catholic), etc.. &lt;br&gt;&#xA;This allows me to discuss the issues that matter with my family and if they revert to appealing to authority I usually then refer the conversation to the priest in our family, who is actually quite open minded about discussing difficult issues of many types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My family knows I generally do not go to mass, and if/when they force me to when I'm home, I take communion to ease the tensions. And, actually, my giving in in these meaningless rituals actually seems to allow them to feel more comfortable with my open questioning of what might otherwise be tumultuous discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose the best strategy I have is to pick my battles wisely, to get them to think about the difficult issues that exist in their faith and the problems it may cause for society at large, while not ruffling at having to go through sometimes hilarious ceremonies to make them more at ease with the &quot;status of my soul&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My sister is the only one who has openly called me an atheist, and while I didn't deny it I suggested that when she uses that word she has a particular view that problem does not encompass most of the atheists that are in the world, and especially does not include me, particularly if by that she meant I had no morals. That has been the most confrontational I've ever had to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general I think blatantly stating &quot;I'm an atheist&quot; may not be in the interest of continued relations with your family. This may raise hackles and make people defensive, when such defenses and hackles need not be raised. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, It to me is unclear whether it is good for the larger atheist community if you do that, though some might say it is, since as a goal that is an endpoint of most atheist communities (i.e. the ability to admit you are an atheist without being subject to discrimination).  I think if you take a more gradual issue-by-issue based approach, perhaps people will understand that you aren't attacking their closely held beliefs out of spite or rejection of your family, but out of sincere concern about the issues at hand.

Many churches require a certain amount of education to be a priest, and so the person you're dealing with will be informed and reasonably secure in his beliefs. He'll have had to debate them, and listen to other sides, etc, etc. Some of the best discussions of atheism I've had, I've had with priests. They understand the arguments, and tend not to be emotionally vested in the answer.

Let's say that the effects of General Relativity have been measured in several tests to astonishing accuracies and they have passed the tests with brio. There are of course problems, like singularities and such, but there are problems in evolutionary theory as well. I'm not sure the comparison is entirely fair though, since the theory of gravitation is older than evolution. GR is recent, but it's actually an improvement upon the older Newtonian theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it wrong to say that the theory of evolution can only ever make qualitative predictions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. Several quantitative predictions have been made. Predicting where you have to look for a particular fossil is in my opinion very quantitative. So are several results in genetics. Evolution also serves as an inspiration for the development of computer algorithms. So that is an example where evolution has provided tools for mathematics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it dangerous to concede the point that biology can not yet live up to the level of quantification of physics, and it never will, thus everything is less certain?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to concede that biology has not yet attained the same level of quantification of physics. Wether that will always be the case is not so clear to me. My hunch would be yes, but with the improvement of computational power and techniques, the gap might become smaller at a fast tempo.

However, the problem isn't in the simple, it's in the effective. The mere fact that someone can say: &quot;God is good&quot; and expect it to mean something more than just those three words requires that &quot;God&quot; and &quot;good&quot; be independent concepts. But the logic of that may be too subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, unfortunately, I don't yet have anything too much more concise than what I've written below. There are two main points that need to be accepted by the religious-believer in order for the argument to hold. Here I build up to the first point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If &quot;good&quot; is nothing more than &quot;whatever God is&quot; or &quot;whatever God says&quot;, and God is not limited, then &quot;good&quot; can mean anything at all. That is, maybe, for the moment, &quot;good&quot; means X, but, of course, God can change that to Y in the next moment &lt;em&gt;for no reason other than whimsy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if the religious were truly complacent with the idea that God is unlimited and therefore can determine what is &quot;good&quot; or isn't on a whim, then they would feel no need for there to be a &quot;reason&quot; (known or unknown) why God would command them to, for instance, rape ten women. They would not need to believe that &quot;God has a reason for doing this [that makes it good]&quot;. It wouldn't matter. We would not feel the need to understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; or that there is, in fact, at least a reason in the mind of God. The moral status of an action would simply be so by decree or, as put another way, &quot;Might Makes Right&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, instead, &quot;good&quot; has some other basis, something independent or, at the very least, indirectly-dependent of God, then the meaning of &quot;good&quot; is more restricted. There would be an actual &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;, hidden or conspicuous, underlying the moral status of particular actions or intentions, not merely an arbitrary decree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this model of morality is accepted (and I do believe it actually is by the majority of religious-believers), then regardless of what that reason is behind what is considered moral, it has been established that there is one as opposed to morality by arbitrary decree. This is the first point that I think should be accepted by the religious believer. If it can't be accepted, then you'll need to go in another direction or, in the case that this is actually true, accept that they believe &quot;might makes right&quot; -- and it is actually as simple as that for them. If another deity defeated or overruled theirs then they would follow that other deity's arbitrary moral decrees. Nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now on to the second point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the first point can be accepted, then most of the work is already done. If there is a reason behind morality, then it is necessarily independent (or indirectly-dependent) of any deity; the deity must apply that reason to determine what is moral and what isn't. Surely a deity could have decided what that reason is, but an establishment of some measure of independence of morality from the deity itself is enough to further the argument. The argument can now become whether or not the deity provided the reason underlying the moral status of actions or whether that reason stands alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To best drive home this second point you can speculate about what reasons could form the basis for morality. For instance, morality could be something that arose from the natural laws of our universe. For instance, because of how our universe behaves, suffering exists and an autonomous being has the ability to cause another to suffer. One might suggest that to intentionally cause suffering as an ends is morally wrong. Keep in mind this is just an example. But the point is that we can examine an action and the intentions behind it to determine &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it should be considered immoral. Furthermore, if the natural laws of the universe changed somehow, changing the consequence but not the action, we may come to another conclusion. If stabbing a puppy actually made the puppy more healthy and happy -- we would have to reconsider how we morally label such an action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this point can be accepted, then the argument is complete and only the conclusion needs to be stated. Namely, if they so wish, they can believe that a deity created the natural laws of the universe and, by doing so, this deity has indirectly set up the rules for morality. However, they must also now concede that, if natural laws can exist without a deity, then so can morality. More fully, morality can exist without any particular religious text or decree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="335" LastEditorUserId="335" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-01-01T03:18:07.393" LastActivityDate="2011-01-01T03:18:07.393" CommentCount="2" />

What is the process by which we decide whether to select A or B? I contend that the process is complex but can be described simply: We measure both A and B according to which we find the most desirable. If desire(X) is a function of how much we desire outcome X, then if desire(A) &gt; desire(B), then we select A from S. That's it. The complexity of the desire() function is something for another discussion (perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now maybe this is something we feel is intuitively true, but I think actually writing it out is important, at least to me. It reveals a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We can't &quot;choose&quot; what we don't want. We will always &quot;choose&quot; the outcome that we perceive to be the most desirable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What we desire &lt;em&gt;determines&lt;/em&gt; our choices.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If we are capable of &quot;choosing&quot; what we desire, it is a &lt;em&gt;meta-operation&lt;/em&gt;; some subset of our desires is not chosen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As an atheist I don't mind reasoning that my choices are merely a product of my desires (I always get to pick what I want! :P), but this is far more troublesome for those who believe they were created by an entity who cares what they choose -- and must have, in way or another, seeded them with desires that determined those choices.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So bringing this back into focus with regard to choosing what we believe.

These are two orthogonal concerns. No amount of satisfied  quantitative predictions should ever result in certainty of a scientific theory but, even if we could not derive a single quantitative prediction from natural selection, we would still have to be certain that it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes is from Darwin's brother in law who saw his theory before it was published. His response to Darwin's concerns was &quot;If the facts don't support this theory, then so much the worse for the facts.&quot; This is absolutely correct. We no more need to look for evidence of natural selection than we need to cut out little paper triangles to verify Pythagoras Theorem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2010-12-30T22:49:43.480" CommentCount="1" />

I'm big on definitions, so I went and got one from dictionary.com (not the most irreproachable of authorities, but good enough to be getting on with):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the state or quality of being loyal; faithfulness to commitments or obligations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;faithful adherence to a sovereign, government, leader, cause, etc. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;an example or instance of faithfulness, adherence, or the like: &lt;em&gt;a man with fierce loyalties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think from this, we can extrapolate 3 different approaches to the stated question, and it yields slightly different answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perceived/expressed value of loyalty&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How important a &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; is loyalty in people's lives? Taking the first definition, of loyalty as the tendency to be consistent and faithful, we could say that the level of importance people place on this value &lt;em&gt;in the abstract&lt;/em&gt; is how &quot;loyal&quot; they can be said to be. On this measure, based on what's gone before in the discussion and some of the links, I would say &lt;strong&gt;religious people and other conservatives probably outpace atheists and liberals in loyalty&lt;/strong&gt;, inasmuch as they consider loyalty a more important value in their system of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Loyalty to groups vs. loyalty to individuals&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the second definition brings in the collective aspect of loyalty, or the ingroup/outgroup view of it. If loyalty is to be defined as the extent to which one identifies with and tends to unconditionally approve of a larger organisation or structure, comprised of people and instantiate in the physical world and with an ingroup identity, e.g. a church, a country, a fan club etc., then the natural assumption to make is that those of a more conservative bent would be more inclined to this frame of mind. Again, this has been well covered above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to loyalty individuals - the tendency to adhere to a specific person regardless of their group identity - the liberal mindset has an advantage over the conservative one, and by extension the atheist over the religious one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a religious view, individuals inherit their right to the loyalty of their peers by continued identification with the group to which they all belong. Once the bonds of loyalty to the group are shaken, there is a knock on effect to the loyalty between the different members. I'm thinking of things like shunning, excommunication, ostracism etc., but also smaller fractures to the fabric of a community of loyalists when doubts or dissent enters the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is much less likely - both in principle and from my personal experience, though I do not have statistics to support this hypothesis - that an atheist would, all other things being equal, cut off their family for becoming religious, than it is that a religious family cuts off a member who is gay, say. It is equally unlikely that an atheist terminate a friendship over church attendance (or other ideological differences not related to religion - veganism, say, or voting Conservative, or Ayn Rand).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this &quot;loyalty gap&quot; is driven both by moral differences (Haidt is relevant here again - care and fairness towards a friend would tend to trump the fact that that friend behaves in a way an atheist or liberal finds unethical) and the attitude towards a multiplicity of views which is at the core of the liberal, and by extension usually atheist, mindset. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this view, &lt;strong&gt;atheists can be supposed to be the more loyal ones to the individuals in their lives&lt;/strong&gt; - friends, family, members of the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Loyalty in word vs. loyalty in action&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we come to look for actual instances of loyalty - as per the third definition above - the picture is somewhat complicated by the messyness of the real world. It's also extremely difficult to get concrete data on atheists as a group. But we do have a lot of anecdotal data on &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; people, especially ones in the public eye: and it is certainly the case that, at least when it comes to sexual fidelity, things don't look too good for the religious. In the US in particular, but elsewhere as well, religious men in the public eye have an almost irresistible bent towards sexual transgression. The list is too long and well known to elaborate here, but one very topical example is the kippa-wearing former Israeli president Moshe Katsav, convicted of multiple sexual assaults this week - not very loyal to his wife or his state office!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Liberals and conservatives are always hurling accusations of hypocrisy and dissimulation at each other. As a progressive, I'm naturally inclined to believe that cpnservatives are hypocritical liars whereas liberals just have a flexibility of mind that allows them to change course when they encounter new data. But this, I must acknowledge, might not be a scientifically objective conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is certainly the case that there are examples of loyalty to home and countny where religion is not concerned. Not all communist revolutionaries were brainwashed or coerced into loyalty to their party and political ideology; many Russian people fought in WWII with the greatest sincerity and from a deep conviction that a secular atheist worker state was worthy of their loyalty, even unto the ultimate sacrifice. Likewise the Maoist rebels still waging a low level civil war on the Indian government are not doing so from religious, but rather political conviction, and of course Che Guevara didn't die in Bolivia out of a lack of loyalty to his cause. So it would seem that religion is not a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; component in patriotism or loyalty to a larger cause, even though it's been appropriated as such in much of the Western discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So maybe &lt;strong&gt;on this third aspect of the question, we must refer to the gods of &quot;more research is needed&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="126" LastActivityDate="2010-12-31T14:07:08.887" CommentCount="2" />

When demographics, health conditions, social connections, and health practices were controlled, this effect remained significant for the entire sample (RH 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-.81), and for both women (RH 0.65, 95% CI 0.554-.76, p&amp;lt;.0001) and men (RH 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.00, p=.05). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Older adults, particularly women, who attend religious services at least once a week appear to have a survival advantage over those attending services less frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's safe to attribute the increased longevity to being socially active. When you have elderly persons, especially those living alone, it's expected that their lifespan would increase if they are out and about in the community. I believe similar studies show increased longevity for married persons, persons with close friends, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, having friends and family around can, for a variety of reasons, help you live longer. Being old and alone is a bad combination. That the study participants were involved in religious services rather than, say, volunteering at the food bank, is (I imagine) inconsequential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, check out this pop-sci article about the study: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/spirituality-may-help-people-live-longer?page=2&amp;amp;print=true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Spirituality May Help People Live Longer&lt;/a&gt;. In the article the study author (Dr. Koenig) pontificates on this correlation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Researchers, including Koenig, say there are limitations to the conclusions anyone should draw from these studies. It could be that people who attend religious services benefit from the social network they form. &quot;It might be that people in churches and synagogues watch out for others, especially the elderly,&quot; encouraging them, for example, to get help if they look sick, Koenig says.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Also, it's known that among today's older men and women, religious belief often leads to less risky behavior, such as less alcohol consumption and smoking. And religious beliefs -- or a strong feeling of spirituality outside of traditional religions -- may improve an individual's ability to cope with the stresses of everyday life and the tribulations of aging, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And later on in the article, this idea is reinforced:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Even people who don't describe themselves as religious probably can benefit from some of the lessons uncovered by research into spirituality and aging, says Harry R. Moody, Ph.D., a gerontologist and author of The Five Stages of the Soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The message isn't 'Go back to church and you'll live a long time,' but stay connected with people on your own wavelength,&quot; says Moody, until recently the director of the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="336" LastActivityDate="2010-12-31T18:48:50.660" CommentCount="1" />

I am not addressing Haidt because I don't think morality and loyalty should be conflated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good ol' Merriam-Webster defines loyal as:&#xA;(a) faithful in allegiance to one's lawful sovereign or government (b) faithful to a private person to whom fidelity is due (c) faithful to a cause, ideal, custom, institution, or product&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;with &quot;faithful&quot; defined as:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(a) steadfast in affection or allegiance (b) firm in adherence to promises or in observance of duty&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Translated, the definition of &lt;b&gt;loyal&lt;/b&gt; is &quot;someone who gives affection and/or allegiance to a person, entity, or cause, and keeps that affection and/or allegiance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to be measured as &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; loyal than anyone else, the question is: when is that affection and/or allegiance withdrawn? Under what circumstances? My criterion as posted above still remains: based on truth. Based on reality. On what can be proven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example: if John Doe is loyal to Group A, he identifies with Group A, he approves of Group A's actions and what Group A promotes, and he proclaims himself a member of Group A. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If Group A is a religion, then John&#xA;is a theist, and his reason for&#xA;loyalty may be that he believes Group&#xA;A is the correct way to worship God. The leaders of Group A also command loyalty: you are supposed to listen to what they say and follow their instructions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If Group A is a political party, John&#xA;may be loyal to them because he&#xA;agrees with their aims.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If Group A is the business where he&#xA;works, John may be loyal because he&#xA;wants to keep his job.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When would he break with Group A? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If he finds a better job. If he gets&#xA;fired. If he discovers that his&#xA;bosses are committing or covering up&#xA;crimes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the stated aims of the party&#xA;change. If the elected leaders do the&#xA;opposite of what they said they would&#xA;do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if John is an atheist, he doesn't have to be loyal to a religion. And theists, who feel they must retain their allegiance to their group to be loyal to it, see this as &lt;em&gt;breaking&lt;/em&gt; allegiance to their group. They see the atheist has NO allegiance to ANY theist group. They see the atheist refusing to follow instructions from ANY theist leader. And they perceive that as being &quot;disloyal.&quot; A Christian can understand how someone can be loyal to Judaism rather than Christianity, but not how someone can reject ANY loyalty to a deity whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why atheists who used to be theists get so much grief. The former theist, who has realized that &quot;god&quot; can't be proven, is not just breaking allegiances with Group A, but with the entire structure of thought and purpose &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; Group A. The atheist is rejecting the &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; for Group A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also the framework behind the &quot;how can you be moral without God?&quot; problem. Theists are showing their loyalty to their group (religion) by following the group's instructions on &quot;how to be good.&quot; A theist may be confused, or appalled, at the idea that a person can determine for him-/herself what constitutes &quot;good&quot; rather than following the instructions already provided by the group, because that means one can be &quot;good&quot; and &quot;not loyal&quot; at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="71" LastActivityDate="2010-12-31T19:24:54.457" />

E.g., Heaven and Hell are believed to be somehow 'outside' this universe, not physical in nature, and are thus supernatural. I think the belief that the term is a meaningful one stems from confusion between concrete and abstract concepts (as henkvanderlaak suggested), leading to the reification of the latter. Those who use the term don't think that the phenomena are simply natural phenomena which are not yet well explained by natural physical laws; they seem to believe that the phenomena are well understood (at least in some cases, e.g., Shamans believe they understand the spirit world), and they are not and cannot be described by physical laws, since they transcend the physical universe. The concept of transcendence falls apart under scrutiny; if something is transcendent in the sense that it has no interaction with the physical universe, how do you know it exists? If it has some form of interaction with the physical universe, how could that be unless that interaction was governed by physical laws?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course every example of supernatural phenomena that I'm aware of has either been shown to not be supernatural, or has a supernatural explanation which is unfalsifiable and therefore meaningless as an explanation (though it may have personal meaning to the individual).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as you and others have implied, the concept of supernatural phenomena stems from ignorance.

It's all a matter whose word do you take for authority - the scientific community that experimented, observed, learned, understood and predicted various phenomena, or leaders of your faith who mostly say what they believe without any evidence other than &quot;It's written in the holy book, and God made it so&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life is too complicated and the scientific subjects are so numerous, that we can't simply know everything from experimenting ourselves. Probably hundreds of thousands of human hours were spent on scientific experimentation, analysis, developing theories and models and verifying it all. That's why we have the scientific method that we can trust because it is very rigorous and it is constantly under inspection through a magnifying glass from other scientists that just want to prove something wrong and get their Nobel prize (kidding, they also want to get a book deal) ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each person chooses whose authority to take. Rational people would take the word of the scientific community, because scientists that are qualified in a specific subject will know what they're talking about more than people who have no qualification is that specific subject. They study the details for years to understand, and if anyone's word can be taken on authority (but not blindly on faith, always demand explanations and proofs!), scientists would be the ones to be authoritative each in his own domain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any person can go and look for the science, read and learn, and understand how it works. There are many figures of authority (scientists) who give lectures and explain how it all works, publish books with references to studies, and some subject may be extremely complicated, but it's not taken on faith. You can take for example the Higgs boson particle that makes sense mathematically, but until it is observed in an experiment, physicists will speculate about its existence but they won't claim that it's in fact a physical particle/wave that is sitting out there. Once a mathematical concept is actually observed, and the experiment is performed by many scientists independently, only then the concept becomes a proven fact of science, and only for as long as it isn't proven to be false by further inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usually when science accepts a hypothesis and it becomes a scientific theory (a.k.a. scientific fact), it means that it's true, at least to explain the specific phenomenon that it was supposed to. Science always improves on itself. Evolution is a scientific fact by all imaginable criteria, although there are debates about specific mechanisms. But as it seems after 150 years, Evolution stands true in any test, prediction and observation that it was put through, it will not be discarded. Of course, a deeper understanding on the mechanisms of selections will arise, but it will not negate evolutionary process as a whole, as we understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religious people take it on faith from figures of authority (priests, preachers, etc.), but unlike in science, these people often have no real qualification in the scientific subjects that they deny. Anyone can say that &quot;Evolution is not true&quot;, but there wasn't anyone who falsified it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We trust science in matters that we can observe, like the fact that the earth is round, and goes around the sun, that gravity attracts objects, etc. Some things are harder to see by yourself, like evolution, quantum mechanics, maybe even global warming.

For example, sequence comparison uses similarity matrices to determine the probability of certain mutations (e.g. the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAM_matrix&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PAM matrix&lt;/a&gt;) which are based off quantitative analysis of evolutionary changes in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the most powerful rebuttal to the argument that gravity is a more certain theory?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To anyone familiar with the subject, this is obvious. To others, not so much. The problem is that gravity, in a sense, is &lt;em&gt;familiar&lt;/em&gt;: we experience it every minute of our life. Evolution is hard to grasp because it operates on extreme scales: the microscopic scale of protein machinery and the gigantic scale of evolutionary time, which is measured in eons. The human mind is not equipped to cope well with either scale (ironically, this is due to evolutionary adaptation of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how about this: &lt;strong&gt;if evolutionary theory were less certain than gravity, modern medicine wouldn’t work&lt;/strong&gt;. It fundamentally relies on the truth of evolution, and nothing would make sense without it. Consider something as simple as animal testing: the whole premise here is that animals are not only incidentally similar to us, but that they are similar &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we have a common ancestor and that the machinery which we are testing the substances against works in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So do paternity tests, AIDS tests, immunizations (flu shot), penicillin production, chemotherapy (cancer medication) and drug design. All of them need &lt;em&gt;reliable&lt;/em&gt; predictions, which evolutionary theory provides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for me, the most impressive prediction is this (adapted from Richard Dawkins): &lt;strong&gt;if we ever find life on another planet anywhere in the vastness of the Universe, we can be &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that its evolution obeys the same basic principles as here&lt;/strong&gt;. They may not share the same information storage mechanism (e.g. DNA) but there will be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; storage, there will be (lossy) copying from one generation to the other, there will be some kind of interpreter of the information and there will be an interplay between environment and “genome” – in summary, there will be mutation and selection. We know this just as certain as we know that that planet will obey the laws of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is it wrong to say that the theory of evolution can only ever make qualitative predictions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess that one is answered, then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is it dangerous to concede the point that biology can not yet live up to the level of quantification of physics, and it never will, thus affirming it is less certain?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just dangerous, it’s wrong.

When drowning became a reality for him, he said, &quot;I believe that there is no god except the One in whom the Children of Israel have believed; I am a submitter.&quot; – surah 10, 90&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surah 10, verse 91 goes on to say: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Today, we will preserve your body, to set you up as a lesson for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;miracle&lt;/em&gt; is at most a metaphor.

And the process is well understood:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally, dead bodies are decomposed by bacteria. These bacteria need water, and a specific saltiness of it. The ancient Egyptians knew that through dehydration, this process could be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water, and all that floats around in it, serve as a source of energy for the bacteria that decomposes the flesh of the dead body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osmosis means that bacteria can't survive heavily salty atmosphere created by pouring &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natron&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;natron&lt;/a&gt; over the body. The semi-permeable cell wall regulates the balance of saltiness to that outside of the cell. If the environment is very salty, the cell dies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of bacteria to decompose the body means that it survives for much longer. Completely dried out, there is not much in the atmosphere to decompose it in that short of a time span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo regulates the humidity and temperature to prevent damage to the Mummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, you assume that the preservation of a body is somehow special. But it can also be viewed as merely a statement of deed. It can be as simple as the Qur'an speaking of some people building a monument, and that monument is still here. That doesn't mean that this monument is a miracle. It is merely an act of some people, and so is the Mummification of the Pharaoh, that was recorded as an artefact of history (yes, there is &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; history in the Qur'an). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider further:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the body weren't preserved today, Qur'an scholars would not call it a &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt;.

For example, not killing. Again using the Bible, the story of Moses includes discussion of rules about killing that already existed in Pharaoh's system, so that could lead to discussion about where that came from. Knowledge of any culture that had little or no contact with the texts they are asserting are the source of morality should be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, they will be relying on someONE telling them that some text is the source of morality, not their own actual analysis of the text or comparisons to other texts.

Whomever is making the assertion has a proclivity for following authority, so this needs to be done delicately, but hopefully they start to see that they are thinking for themselves.

As for extra-Biblical corobarating evidence, I have found the same as what Denis posted. That leaves us with the evidence of writers from within a small group of people, some of those writings were canonized. If you are looking for inaccuracies within the BIble, it is not that hard to just read the first few pages of Matthew then Luke and see the differences in the birth narrative. Other stories take a little more work, and plenty of people have gone to great lengths to make up ways to justify the differences, so that isn't always the best route to take in a discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More interesting are the claims that come straight from the Bible, like there being thousands of witnesses to the cruxificion. Some people take that as, well, gospel, and others simply dismiss it. How do you decide who is right? Saying that it was written 30 to 70 years after the fact sounds pretty damning, but comparitively that is not too bad for documents that come from that time period. Theists often site Socrates or Augustus Ceasar as historical figures with similar types of evidence. Some point out that we have no original copies of the gospels, again not unusual for documents from that period. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not arguing for a historically accurate Jesus, I'm just pointing out that it is more interesting than simply believing it or not and it is debatable by historians.

The most troubling aspect to me is that the documents we have came from a small group of people, all of them claiming the stories were true.

It's simple, it's happy, it's friendly, and the works thing is a core tenet of theirs, so while atheists are out protesting christmas trees at the courthouse, church people are out fixing old ladies houses for free, and paying for schools in Haiti, etc, etc. Atheists have a few charities that do some of this stuff, but they're small and poorly funded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know everyone here likes to paint all religious people as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.godhatesfags.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fred Phelps&lt;/a&gt;, but the vast majority of religious people aren't like that, and when you go up to someone and tell them they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, they're going to get pissed. Atheism has very little community feeling, atheism does very few good works as an organized group. All we have is reason, and that's not going to cut it for most people. A comfortable lie beats an uncomfortable truth any day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those reasons, I think pushing atheism on theists is counterproductive. It doesn't work, and you give them a nice negative example, the way annoying evangelical southern baptists give &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; a nice negative example. But there are very few good positive examples to counterbalance it, so it just makes the rest of us look like dicks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="169" LastActivityDate="2011-01-04T17:06:20.270" CommentCount="4" />

That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.

He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ...

To answer your question, which seems like a semantic question about how far anti-theism can be taken before it becomes discrimination,  here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1982/1982_81_3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bob Jones University v. U. S. (1982)&lt;/a&gt; (Oyez abstract). The concurrence is that &lt;strong&gt;discrimination is one exercise of free speech / religion that may be burdened by the state.&lt;/strong&gt; In other more practical words, your anti-theism can be restricted if it crosses over into prohibitory hiring or servicing practices, and likely if you show a marked favortism for anti-theists. In your case you are not likely tax-exempt as an anti-theist foundation, however I believe a case like this would bear civil impact and the person who brings suit would have a claim to relief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Facts of the Case: &#xA;  Bob Jones University was dedicated to &quot;fundamentalist Christian beliefs&quot; which included prohibitions against interracial dating and marriage. Such behavior would lead to expulsion. In 1970, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) changed its formal policy to adopt a district court decision that prohibited the IRS from giving tax-exempt status to private schools engaging in racial discrimination. The IRS believed that the University's policies amounted to racism and revoked its tax-exempt status. The University claimed that the IRS had abridged its religious liberty. This case was decided together with Goldsboro Christian Schools Inc. v. United States, in which Goldsboro maintained a racially discriminatory admissions policy based upon its interpretation of the Bible, accepting for the most part only Caucasian students. The IRS determined that Goldsboro was not an exempt organization and hence was required to pay federal social security and unemployment taxes. After paying a portion of such taxes for certain years, Goldsboro filed a refund suit claiming that the denial of its tax-exempt status violated the U.S. Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Question: &#xA;  Can the government prohibit race discrimination at the expense of the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clauses?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Conclusion: &#xA;  The Court found that the IRS was correct in its decision to revoke the tax- exempt status of Bob Jones University and the Goldsboro Christian School. These institutions did not meet the requirement by providing &quot;beneficial and stabilizing influences in community life&quot; to be supported by taxpayers with a special tax status. The schools could not meet this requirement due to their discriminatory policies. The Court declared that racial discrimination in education violated a &quot;fundamental national public policy.&quot; The government may justify a limitation on religious liberties by showing it is necessary to accomplish an &quot;overriding governmental interest.&quot; Prohibiting racial discrimination was such a governmental interest. Hence, the Court found that &quot;not all burdens on religion are unconstitutional.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, you might be interested in some boilerplate legalese regarding non-discrimination:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The [entity] shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, or national origin.

The purpose was to create a framework for adjudicators of asylum seekers that are seeking asylum on the grounds of religious persecution&lt;/a&gt;.(All quotes below belong to this article, pp. 189-215)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His purpose is to emphasize that not all three conditions should be required of the petitioner, and the adjudicator should assess the three following features of a religion when trying to understand whether or how someone has/n't been persecuted:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;religion in its metaphysical or theological sense (e.g., the underlying truth of the existence of God, the dharma, etc.)&quot;; &quot;Religion as belief&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;religion as it is psychologically experienced by people (e.g., the feelings of&#xA;the religious believer about divinity or ultimate concerns, the holy, etc.)&quot;; &quot;Religion as identity&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;religion as a cultural or social force (e.g., symbolism that binds a&#xA;community together or separates it from other communities)&quot;; &quot;Religion as a way of life&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mr Gunn then moves on to explain the two different approaches to defining a religion, the essentialist (where one picks a single trait shared among all, ie. &quot;All Religions believe in a g/God&quot;, and the &quot;polythetic&quot; where the religions are not bound by a singular, essential trait but by shared familial traits. To explain the latter, he references a 1965 US Supreme Court quote: &quot;[T]he test of belief “in a relation to a Supreme Being” [in a law providing for conscientious objector status from military service] is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As religious and political persecution are means for an Asylum-seeker's application to be granted, it seems incumbent upon the atheist community to have a presence in these proceedings that isn't strictly limited to political persecution. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As a note: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rapidimmigration.com/1_eng_kit_asylum.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;(the determination of) political asylum (is) based on an actual experience of persecution in your home country or fear of persecution based on race, religion, or political opinion&lt;/a&gt;. The requirements not only of actual or precedence of persecution make it very difficult to have atheism, when not viewed as a religious category, be grounds for political asylum. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Political persecution is hard to prove without extreme examples of religious police&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Violence of one group of [Religion A members] against atheists does not constitute political or religious persecution, just as Drug Cartels' violence is not indicative of systematic persecution of the people it harms. (It means there is an enforcement problem, and the religious aspect is classified as happenstance.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to strengthen the case for atheists that fear/experience persecution, and that cannot describe atheism as a religion (or religious category), how can we construct a logical case for religious persecution of atheism?

(&lt;em&gt;Your Functional Definition&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Political persecution overrides religious in some cases (i.e. Shari'a law, &quot;neutral&quot; laws (p. 213) based on religious norms, etc) but is harder to prove, also in cases (also, where the predominant cultural group is religiously oppressive; Mutawwa'in example on pg. 211); however, answers should have a recourse for atheist seekers of asylum, so on what basis can one form a claim of persecution if one's &quot;religion&quot; isn't really a religion?

I was on the role as a United Methodist in a sanctioned church, but that church did not require that I recite the Nicene or Apostle's creed to become a member. They made up their own initiation that spoke of being a &quot;sojourner&quot;, a seeker of wisdom. Jesus Christ may have been the primary provider of the wisdom that was preached on Sundays, but his name wasn't mentioned all that much. We read Crossan and Borg and publicly went against the authority of the church and welcomed gays. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It all seemed logical to me. The stories from the Bible have good lessons, and I wanted to be around people who did good things, and they happened to be hanging out at a church. The people were acting consistently, that is practicing what they preached, so no logical problems there. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were limits, such as the person who decided to follow Islam. He would still show up sometimes, but he is no longer a member. Another person who attends often is a Jew. He offers stories and lessons from his tradition, but does not want to &quot;convert&quot;. There were many others such as myself that would never have gone to any other to church. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many other examples. If you define religion as a psychological or social force, you have already eliminated the supernatural force. I have experienced the power of a community that lovingly supports its members without a need to draw on prepared prayers spoken in unison or invocations of the names of saints or prophets so the question proposes no problems for me. I got the benefit of a religious-like community without the woo-woo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I quit the church because an entity that large changes too slow and large parts of it are engaged in activities such anti-gay or pro-military that I don't think are logically consistent with the teachings that it claims to base its platform on. The only reason I could see that it would be logically incoherent to be a religious adherent is that the religions themselves are not logically coherent. But one could be created that is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus was advocating that his religion needed to change, and Paul stated that people could now base their laws on love, not the 400 and however many rules in Deuteronomy. So, 2,000 years later, it is not that far fetched that we can say God doesn't exist. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walkerchurch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here is the website of the church, just so you can see I am not making it up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;To add a finer point on this, the UMC is very aware of the philosophy of this church, so there is some sort of internal logical consistency that allows for churches like this, who are challenging the establishment, to exist within that establishment. This is as logical as having a communist party openly running for office in the United States. Change, in the UMC, comes from within, by design, with regular voting that starts by congregations selecting delegates and bubbling up to the international conference. For that to have any value, there has to be an allowance for non-conformity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could see why if you view religion as a rigid set of beliefs with change only coming from a small group at the top, then this question would seem logically difficult. But if you allow for religions that include many viewpoints and open discussion, and many of them do, then out of the millions of people going to church, you have to accept that eventually someone is going to stand up and say, &quot;hey, wait a minute, God is not consistently portrayed in this book we read every week. And what difference does it make if we believe in a virgin or not? I like what we are doing here, but does it really require that we believe these things?&quot; And eventually a discussion group would form, then a committee, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has been going on for decades. Most people just leave, or just keep quiet when they have these thoughts, but a few have stayed and we have movements like The Emergent Church and people like Brian McClaren and John Shelby Spong.

It appears mythical nowadays, because it was written in a religious context - Not too many atheists lived in 500 B.C India!

The Buddha himself never claimed to be a deity, and made it perfectly clear that he will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; return after his death.

If one has time to ponder if life is meaningful to live, maybe one should reflect a bit deeper and realize the exceptional situation one is in to even be able to ask oneself such a question. This is sheer luxury, other people are struggling to survive. Don't think they ever ask themselves this question.

I'm not sure if he has any references for that, but it has always made sense to me. It is pretty much where religion started out, historically speaking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The internal dialog that Holden Caulfield has in &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is probably pretty accurate for what young people go through when they are trying to figure what god is, or what his real name is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think science has to be learned. We have to learn that our direct observations can lead us to inaccurate conclusions, that the easiest person to fool is ourselves as Feynman said. It doesn't seem natural to me that we would ask people to recreate our experiments and confirm our results. We only do that now, since we have discovered so many amazing things using that method. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all opinion. I don't know of any study or science on belief in infant brains. You could look up Piaget for interesting social psychology on children. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&#xA;I have seen this on a couple other answers elsewhere in this SE:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;first, religion in its metaphysical or theological sense (e.g., the underlying truth of the existence of God, the dharma, etc.); second, religion as it is psychologically experienced by people (e.g., the feelings of the religious believer about divinity or ultimate concerns, the holy, etc.); and third, religion as a cultural or social force (e.g., symbolism that binds a community together or separates it from other communities). Definitions of religion typically begin by assuming one of these three different theoretical approaches -T. Jeremy Gunn 2003,2008&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and have discussed in &quot;meta&quot; that it might be worth applying this to many questions. So here goes.

The questioner would have to clarify if this is what they meant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the quesitioner is asking about #2, it gets more interesting (IMHO). We can't know everything about infant psychology, but we have some sense that they feel love and wonder and a connection to their mother. It seems pretty obvious that children have more of a proclivity to believe since they go for the Santa Claus story pretty easily and have imaginary friends. Sunday School teachers know about this and exploit it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but I'll wait for clarification on what the question actually is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="584" LastEditorUserId="584" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-01-12T15:25:07.940" LastActivityDate="2011-01-12T15:25:07.940" CommentCount="3" />

One is that of substance, the other is the dualism of these substances. A substance is characterized by its properties, but, according to those who believe in substances, it is more than the collection of the properties it possesses, it is the thing which possesses them. So the mind is not just a collection of thoughts, but is that which thinks, an immaterial substance over and above its immaterial states. Properties are the properties of objects. If one is a property dualist, one may wonder what kinds of objects possess the irreducible or immaterial properties in which one believes... Now one might try to think of these subjects as just bundles of the immaterial states. This is Hume's view. But if one thinks that the owner of these states is something quite over and above the states themselves, and is immaterial, as they are, one will be a substance dualist. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#SubDua&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that someone would, from the perspective of a materialist, contrive or conjure up such a system is evidence of the person trying to interpret the world around them. It is not a defect of their reasoning, instead it is typically argued that there is a cognitive dissonance in the concept of materialist claims to knowledge, principally that they have no intuitive understanding of qualitative knowledge. Here is an example from the SEP:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[I]magine a future scientist who has lacked a certain sensory modality from birth, but who has acquired a perfect scientific understanding of how this modality operates in others. This scientist — call him Harpo — may have been born stone deaf, but become the world's greatest expert on the machinery of hearing: he knows everything that there is to know within the range of the physical and behavioural sciences about hearing. Suppose that Harpo, thanks to developments in neurosurgery, has an operation which finally enables him to hear. It is suggested that he will then learn something he did not know before, which can be expressed as what it is like to hear, or the qualitative or phenomenal nature of sound. These qualitative features of experience are generally referred to as qualia. If Harpo learns something new, he did not know everything before. He knew all the physical facts before. So what he learns on coming to hear — the facts about the nature of experience or the nature of qualia — are non-physical. This establishes at least a state or property dualism. (See Jackson (1982); Robinson (1982)) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#ArgForDua&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cit. SEP&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frequently, people who cannot commit to the ontological leap of materialism are often hung up on the &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt; mentioned above. A materialist rebuttal is often, &quot;there's an up until now uncalculated variable for that.&quot; The dualist riposte is &quot;intuitively speaking, the idea of being able to know all things a priori, as a matter of variables, without experiencing them sounds far fetched.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2011-01-12T21:51:59.113" />

It's not like theists do not cry at funerals or are not afraid of death. I believe it is basic human nature to act and feel as if there was no afterlife - because in human experience &lt;em&gt;there is no afterlife&lt;/em&gt;. Even if it actually existed - nobody has the possibility of experiencing it and making it something more than mere hope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I believe deal with the hard facts of life and death, at a personal level, in a very similar manner. Possibly they simply think about something else than death - like living life!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second point that is interesting is this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death is a double concept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Death means both the moment of passing and the eternity that follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everybody fears the first (or at least the slow and painful version of it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second sense, for an atheist there is no &quot;after death&quot;. Life ends there, so there is, at least for some, basically no feeling for what happens after the passing to themselves. The same thoughts for friends and family apply as to a theist, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the thought of having an afterlife is actually &lt;em&gt;only comforting a small minority of theists&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. the ones that have no fear of being punished in the afterlife.

You can't understand something if you don't listen to it and read up on it. You have an advantage because there are many that have already done the work and left you with good starting points, so you can begin your study with a fair amount of certainty that you are confirming what you already know. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, you no doubt believe Revelations is allegory, not an actual prediction of the end times that can be deciphered. Take a few minutes and read it and you can confirm that. Trouble is, someone comes along and says that you need to understand the symbolism, or you need to read everything Calvin wrote, and you're wondering how you get around that. You are fairly certain that no matter how many of the symbols you can trace or how many interpretations you read, you are not going to be able to demonstrate the inconsistencies and prove that Revelations is not whatever this idealist says it is. And your right. That's how theology works. You would prove it to yourself, but you knew it with just a cursory look. Theology relies on people accepting something is true without evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Daniel Dennett puts it “Theology is a way of not coming clean about the whole enterprise.”&#xA;It relies on making propositions that seem to be profound, but only because it is actually logically ill-formed. These propositions have 2 readings:&#xA;        On one, it is true but trivial&#xA;        On the other, it is false, but would be earth-shattering if it were true&#xA;An example would be &quot;love is just a word&quot;. True, it is a word, and if that's all it was, that would be earth shattering. But love is much more than that and we get to live in the world where it is hard to define and we have to struggle with that. But a theologian tries to get around questions of god's existence and says things like, &quot;god is no being at all&quot; and goes on selling books while you try to work out through the logic of that. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, in most cases, there is an easy way out. Just ask the person if they have read Revelations, or whatever they are using as evidence for how their thinking is valid. Most won't have, they are just repeating what someone else said, and you ask who that is. If they have read it, ask for more specifics. They will be vague. If they are specific, you will note the inconsistencies in their line of reasoning, and if you ask for clarification, they will either interrupt you or get the point that you aren't going to accept their reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, that's how I handle trying to understand the thinking of people who are right in front of me. To understand how so many human beings came to think this way, you will have to study.

Instead, we go to our deaths knowing that it is nothing more than it is, an ending.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally take a great deal of comfort from that.  Why?

We understand what people mean by that but we don't understand how it's a valid explanation of one's belief. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're not alone in that, by the way. As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Invisible Pink Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Russell's teapot&lt;/a&gt;, Santa Claus, and the Tooth Fairy demonstrate, all humans do not consider faith without evidence to justify a belief &lt;em&gt;except when it comes to religion&lt;/em&gt;, where belief without evidence is deemed reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While that may seem like special pleading to an atheist (&quot;Why do you believe in your god but not Santa Claus?&quot;), it isn't. Theists almost always believe that their religious beliefs best explain something about the Universe. Perhaps it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;why something exists&lt;/a&gt; rather than nothing, or the level of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;complexity in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_morality&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;origin of morality&lt;/a&gt; but, whatever it is, a theist will feel that his or her religious belief best explains what they know of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atheists will disagree over the validity of that explanation and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is where the real disagreement is. Atheists feel that gods do not meet &lt;a href=&quot;http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11046&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the criteria for a good explanation&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Testability:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations render specific predictions that can be falsified or corroborated.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Scope (aka “comprehensiveness”):&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations explain more types of phenomena.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Precision:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations explain phenomena with greater precision.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Simplicity:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations make use of fewer claims, especially fewer as yet unsupported claims (“lack of ad-hoc-ness”).&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Mechanism:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations provide more information about underlying mechanisms.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Unification:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations unify apparently disparate phenomena (also sometimes called “consilience”).&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Predictive novelty:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations don’t just “retrodict” what we already know, but predict things we observe only after they are predicted.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Analogy (aka “fit with background knowledge”): &lt;/b&gt;Better explanations generally fit with what we already know with some certainty.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Past explanatory success:&lt;/b&gt; Better explanations fit within a tradition or trend with past explanatory success (e.g. astronomy, not astrology).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To atheists, a god is a complex, untestable hypothesis that violate many of the laws we know govern the physical world and offer no predictions.

In one case, it is whether God exists, in the other case it is whether your spouse loves you. (In full formalism, it might be more like trying to decide the probability of a set of hypotheses is true or false, but we need not split those hairs here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, assuming that there is a contrasting set of hypotheses, then you can perform inference about how the evidence lines up in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now one way in which these things may be different are in the types of evidence that supports the two classes of hypotheses. It may be that the class of evidence that is potentially consistent (ideally uniquely consistent) with the hypotheses that god exists is wider than the class of evidence that supports your belief that your spouse loves you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, i.e. if there are less ways the world can exist that are consistent with the idea that your spouse loves you, then the hypotheses that your spouse loves you is likely to gain more weight more rapidly, since the probability of hypotheses outside this set will, by definition, decrease. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if your hypotheses can accommodate essentially any kind of evidence(i.e. no matter what your spouse does, you think she loves you), then there is less evidence that has low probability given that she does not love you, and thus it will be difficult to ever change or sufficiently (rationally) justify your belief in your spouse's love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the god hypotheses can accommodate everything and the spouse love hypotheses can accommodate everything, then they are highly similar.

You can point out these contradictions, and if they reject logic, well then you can point out the problems with that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they do not provide a definition which allows for a falsifiable notion of &quot;god's&quot; existence, then you can retreat to the ignostic position of &quot;well that doesn't mean anything...&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they do not have any contradictions in their features, and it is a falsifiable proposition, e.g. they merely appeal to god's sometimes intervention in the world (e.g. answer occasional prayers), at least you now know where the assumptions lie and know which issues need to be directly addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they list both undefinability and particular beliefs regarding the definition of god, that is so transparently contradictory that it almost does not warrant your time talking to the person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In sum, by taking the position of &quot;I don't know what god is, it's not a concept that I can use&quot; you force the theists' hand to clarify the argument.

Every ten years, states gain or lose seats depending on relative percentages each state has of the overall US population, so a state whose population growth is faster than the national average will gain seats, and those whose growth is slower than the average will lose seats. Then each state will redraw their own congressional districts based on the number of seats they now have, and this is an extremely political exercise, often disproportionately favoring certain politicians over others.

But it is our willingness to let go of a belief when evidence to the contrary is presented that is the most important indicator of &quot;faith&quot; as opposed to simple &quot;belief&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I make the bold claim that Faith is belief in the face of contrary evidence for that reason. Faith appears when the holder of a belief resists the necessary rejection of a belief. In most cases, when we believe something with insufficient evidence, we have no issue with dropping the belief when proven wrong. An example: I might think that my cat is behind the couch. I don't have any direct evidence of this, just a sense that since this has often happened before, it's likely to be the case this time as well. But if I go and look behind the couch, and my cat is not there, I will drop my belief that my cat was there without much thought. That is belief. Most scientific ideas fall into that category: we have no real personal stake in whether the idea is true or not, even if we could possibly find it attractive that it be so or not so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We enter the realm of Faith when a belief is dear enough to us to affect our identity. Most people speak of Faith as very much a defining characteristic of their being. When a belief we hold dear enough to define ourselves by it, in whole or in part, is challenged by evidence (or by the strong argumentation of another), our natural tendency is to adopt a defensive attitude, and to raise a wall of protection around that belief. Since letting go of that belief would require us to review how we see ourselves, and since that is not usually considered a pleasant experience by most adults, we will likely show a varying degree of resistance to the new information. The level of resistance offered is not usually linked to the strength of the evidence provided, but rather to the degree to which one identifies oneself with that belief. It is then that very resistance which defines Faith as different from Belief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All humans believe in some things without sufficient evidence. We could never function without that ability. We are pattern-detection engines, and we often will detect patterns when there is scant evidence available. So belief is not at issue here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But most scientifically minded people are wary of Faith; the resistance to evidence inherent in Faith is antithetical to the scientific method and mindset. That does not mean that we don't fall into the trap at times. The history of scientific revolutions can attest to the amount of resistance of certain scientists to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here is the fundamental difference between the Atheist and the Theist with regard to Faith.

For example, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-alpha_process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;finely tuned coincidence&lt;/a&gt; allows carbon atoms to form in abundant quantities. Life, as we know it, is based on carbon - so apparently it would look like a 'miraculous' coincidence. Well, yes - as long as carbon is a prerequisite for intelligent life (we don't know that for sure), as long as there is no previously undiscovered physical law that mandates that &quot;coincidence&quot;, as long as no other &quot;coincidences&quot; are always formed by changing the constants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there's much we don't know and especially &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe#Disputes_on_the_extent_and_existence_of_fine-tuning&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;we are not really sure that we have a problem at all!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the scientific consensus on the (strong) anthropic principle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle#Criticisms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;physicists are not very happy&lt;/a&gt; with it, because it doesn't explain anything basically. If a multitude of universes were created, each with its own constants set, then it would be fairly unsurprising that we live in one with a set such as to support intelligent life. However, postulating multiple universes is not really an accepted theory at the moment as obviously experimental proof is necessary, and we have no idea yet on how to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in other words, use the anthropic principle lightly - certainly more lightly than Dawkins does in The God Delusion. Things are very grey in that area scientifically.

Can we allow any/every sect to demand the right to erect worship structures throughout &quot;public&quot; space, and then demand that the public HAS to fund them for ALL religions that wish to do so?

Any sect making unilateral claims to ultimate authority, superceding societal arbitration and law, cannot be accommodated.  Generally, assertions of &quot;faith before law&quot; cannot be accommodated in a society that purports to be secular, tolerant, diverse.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.austindacey.com/books.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Austin Dacey's excellent book &quot;The Secular Conscience&quot;&lt;/a&gt; covers this concept in detail.

Allowing ideas to enter and mingle at the table of society's negotiations, is how we can sift and winnow the crap ideas from the brilliant.  When a sect demands the right to unilaterally define what is or is not offensive to it, and then backs it up through extra-legal enforcement measures, I cannot accommodate.  This does not mean I advocate incivility, but that no person engaged in conversation may play the &quot;offense&quot; or &quot;blasphemy&quot; trump card... it is too large a claim placed upon the individual AND upon the society.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, on the front addressed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-10-11-column11_ST_N.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;so thoroughly by Gerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt;, I cannot accommodate... when the claim is inserted into the public sphere, not just some random wingnut's anecdotal claims...

In response, the university amended its policy to allow religious student groups to “adopt a nondiscrimination statement that is consistent” with their sincerely held religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the AU, this may change.

And, at the most basic of levels, it ties in with the university's official &quot;recognition&quot; of the group.  As a state institution, there are serious constitutional questions surrounding the recognition of a blatantly christian organization, as the state is officially not supposed to appear to be supporting one religion over another.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would begin by publicly asking why this group is even seeking university recognition in the first place.  What benefits does recognition confer upon the group?  A post office box?  The group is free to meet on-campus following any other protocols for finding meeting places as any other group, officially sanctioned or otherwise.  This might be sufficient to call out the real reasons why they're seeking recognition.  The university won't take a position about any groups of students who meet to do something for any reason as long as it's not outwardly illegal (so the OSU Drug Running, Prostitution, and Money Laundering Student Group wouldn't be able to continue with its activities no matter what).  Recognition does not really give that much more of a benefit, so it's not a question of the free speech to which they're entitled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If they insist upon seeking recognition, then a reasonable response would be to create a new student group ostensibly based upon a religion that this other group would consider antithetical to their own views.  Satanism actually serves this purpose quite nicely.  If the Satanist group is rejected in its petition for recognition, you have a legitimate grievance against the university in that it permitted one religious group but not yours.  If it is approved in its petition for recognition, stick to the group's charter but allow its actions to follow the movements of the Christian group.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simple truth of the matter is that freedom of religion applies to all religions or none at all.  Ditto for free speech.  If someone wants to proclaim their faith loudly and publicly, that's certainly their prerogative, but that just sets the stage for others of opposite views to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="205" LastActivityDate="2011-01-19T19:01:48.413" CommentCount="2" />

A finely tuned theory only works for a very small region of parameter space, suggesting that the theory itself might be &quot;overly engineered&quot; to make it work.  Basically, when trying to come up with a theory, it is easy to jury rig some ideas together that would produce unrealistic behavior, but that this behavior is hidden by fine cancellations or making some effects minuscule by hand (as opposed to a consequence from some principle). It's basically a way to guess at the likelihood of a theory being accurate, when many theories make equally accurate predictions of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example might clear things up.  There is a problem in particle physics called the &quot;Hierarchy Problem,&quot; where the mass of Higgs Boson would be far too large without lots of fine tuning &lt;em&gt;in the Standard Model&lt;/em&gt;.  Other theories, such as low energy supersymmetry don't require this fine tuning, and so are said to &quot;solve the Hierarchy Problem&quot;. This is a major reason why physicists are studying supersymmetry, even though there are no experimental results to date that mandate it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When people say the Universe is fine tuned for life, they really mean that the Standard Model and General Relativity are fine tuned for life.  The fine tuning may disappear or be reduced in a more accurate theory.  Perhaps there is even a zero parameter theory, which couldn't have any fine tuning at all.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, the fine tuning argument really says that our best explanations, &lt;em&gt;to date&lt;/em&gt;, don't explain some coincidences.

This guy quietly moved out of the pastorate into a staff job with the regional denominational organization, which he held for a couple of decades until he died of AIDS. I suspect they might do the same thing around clergy who lost their faith, and maybe even help them train for another profession.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things are different with less hierarchical and less tolerant groups, like the Baptists and most Pentecostal and independent charismatic churches.

It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery. When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exposed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[Adolf Hitler, speech in Munich on April 12, 1922, countering a political opponent, Count Lerchenfeld, who opposed antisemitism on his personal Christian feelings.

Indeed, the Talmud is not a book to prepare a man for the hereafter, but only for a practical and profitable life in this world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[Adolf Hitler, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Vol. 1, Chapter 11]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The best characterization is provided by the product of this religious education, the Jew himself.

This is fairly common because of the intentional misinformation disseminated by the 'intelligent design' religious folks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the mammalian eye is fascinating, and the story of its evolution is illustrative of the manner in which other complex structures may have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote from pbs.org in their evolution library &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/01/1/l_011_01.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here's how some scientists think some eyes may have evolved: The simple light-sensitive spot on the skin of some ancestral creature gave it some tiny survival advantage, perhaps allowing it to evade a predator. Random changes then created a depression in the light-sensitive patch, a deepening pit that made &quot;vision&quot; a little sharper. At the same time, the pit's opening gradually narrowed, so light entered through a small aperture, like a pinhole camera.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Every change had to confer a survival advantage, no matter how slight. Eventually, the light-sensitive spot evolved into a retina, the layer of cells and pigment at the back of the human eye. Over time a lens formed at the front of the eye. It could have arisen as a double-layered transparent tissue containing increasing amounts of liquid that gave it the convex curvature of the human eye.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, eyes corresponding to every stage in this sequence have been found in existing living species. The existence of this range of less complex light-sensitive structures supports scientists' hypotheses about how complex eyes like ours could evolve. The first animals with anything resembling an eye lived about 550 million years ago. And, according to one scientist's calculations, only 364,000 years would have been needed for a camera-like eye to evolve from a light-sensitive patch. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What's important to understand about the process is that it is gradual across many generations, and very, very many dead ends that don't produce a competitive advantage for the evolving organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other good links are referenced off of wikipedia. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the term &quot;The invisible hand of the market&quot; to describe capitalism?

However, it's not the intangible and dubious idea of a creator, it's the very real and very visible competition among animals and plants to survive.  If a mutation occurs, it is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; likely to be a bad mutation leading to the death of the organism or to its inability to procreate or compete for resources as well as another, non-mutated member of the same species.  However, from time to time slight genetic variation gives rise to a mutation that confers some small advantage to competition and survival.  That organism is far more likely to survive, prosper, and thus pass along those genes.  Over time that trait can become dominant.

This assumption is one only held by those already indoctrinated to believe that there is something special about the bible as compared with any other set of books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, whether or not any atheist does this, in no way makes his conclusions more or less valid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the last phrase implies the question, &quot;Are atheists atheist just because they haven't done enough research, and are therefore making unjustified conclusions?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those &quot;straw-man&quot; positions that are often presented by believers.

In 2007 the Discovery Institute reported that about 600 scientists signed their A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism list, up from 100 in 2001. The actual statement of the Scientific Dissent from Darwinism is a relatively mild one that expresses skepticism about the absoluteness of 'Darwinism' (and is in line with the falsifiability required of scientific theories) to explain all features of life, and does not in any way represent an absolute denial or rejection of evolution. By contrast, a tongue-in-cheek response known as Project Steve, a list of scientists named Steve who agree that evolution is &quot;a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences,&quot; has 1080 Steves as of March 26, 2009. People named Steve make up approximately 1% of the total U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The United States National Science Foundation statistics on US yearly science graduates demonstrate that from 1987 to 2001, the number of biological science graduates increased by 59% while the number of geological science graduates decreased by 20.5%. However, the number of geology graduates in 2001 was only 5.4% of the number of graduates in the biological sciences, while it was 10.7% of the number of biological science graduates in 1987. The Science Resources Statistics Division of the National Science Foundation estimated that in 1999, there were 955,300 biological scientists in the US (about 1/3 of who hold graduate degrees). There were also 152,800 earth scientists in the US as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the 600 Darwin Dissenters signing the A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism represent about 0.054% of the estimated 1,108,100 biological and geological scientists in the US in 1999. In addition, a large fraction of the Darwin Dissenters have specialties unrelated to research on evolution; of the dissenters, three-quarters are not biologists. Therefore, the roughly 150 biologist Darwin Dissenters represent about 0.0157% of the US biologists that existed in 1999. As of 2006, the list was expanded to include non-US scientists, overestimating the number of US scientists that do not accept evolution according to the Discovery Institute, a known creationist lobby institution. Despite the increase in absolute number of scientists willing to sign the dissent form, proportionately the figures indicates the support from scientists for creationism and intelligent design is steadily decreasing, despite an increase in public support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="484" LastEditorUserId="484" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-01-26T17:25:58.740" LastActivityDate="2011-01-26T17:25:58.740" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-01-26T17:19:32.323" />

That means that Pantheism is really nothing by Metaphysical Materialism with a fuzzy-wuzzy name).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with &quot;Ignosticism&quot; is the same as with Deism. There's a distinction without a cause made here, where the &quot;concept&quot; of God is considered distinct somehow with &quot;God&quot; itself. The fundamental problem with Deism is that the concept of God they promote is one where God does not (cannot, will not) have any effect in the world. There's certainly no credible evidence of divine intervention in Nature. That means that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no God, however defined, as long as it implies that such a &quot;thing&quot; could impact the world in any way.

Saying X created the Universe explains absolutely &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. Just the fact that we may need to explain how the Universe started does not justify the creation of a hypothesis that does not explain how the Universe started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some sort of unknown connection between Nature and something outside of Nature, which has no impact on Nature, but which also, somehow, acts on Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course this is utterly contradictory, but it is a view held by many.

Knowledge and experience acquisition during childhood is definitely modulated by genetics; for example, we humans have a long childhood because we need to acquire a large amount of knowledge and experience from our parents and other family. Other animals with simpler brains and simpler social structures have shorter childhoods. The length of the childhood (as a component of the maturing rate) is genetically established. And, thus, religion, as a byproduct of this, is related to such genetic modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I don't think there is a &quot;God gene&quot; or a direct connection between genetics and religion.

For this to occur they say there must be a blending of the rhythmic stimulation with ideas. Once this occurs &quot;…ritual turns a meaningful idea into a visceral experience.&quot; Moreover they say that humans are compelled to act out myths by the biological operations of the brain due to what they call the &quot;inbuilt tendency of the brain to turn thoughts into actions&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Studies of the brain and religious experience&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Early studies in the 1950s and 1960s attempted to use EEGs to study brain wave patterns correlated with &quot;spiritual&quot; states.

Let's start with the nature of skepticism as a whole: there is no shortage of ideas in life that deserve a healthy degree of skepticism.  Some skeptical groups are wary of atheists not because they agree or disagree with us, but rather because we do sometimes tend to drown out all of the other topics because of the very nature of religion. (And they do have a point...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the critical thinking process as a whole: it's often difficult to completely separate our personal experiences and prejudices from that which we observe, even when thinking critically. Cultural anthropologists wrestle with the personal bias all the time and have to learn to separate their own experiences (and the lens it provides) from their observations of cultures that are completely foreign to them.  Now extend that to someone who might have been indoctrinated into the existence and idea if god since before they learned to walk.  That's an amazingly difficult bias to overcome. More likely, their &quot;critical thinking&quot; is going to end up rejecting atheism and seeking out even the most tenuous critiques of our worldview, rather than cast aside their own.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we must keep in mind that skepticism gives us some conspiracy theories as well. I'm particularly fond of the one that holds that we never landed on the moon, because it is quite creative, moderately compelling, and, to use a technical term, complete bullshit.  When you read some of those so-called theories, it does help to remember where our own personal biases might lie.

For a couple of hundred years during the late middle ages and early renaissance, bathing routinely was regarded with great suspicion, and was thought to lead to ungodly fascination with the body and vice.  Since people who bathed regularly tended to outlive those that didn't, and because of emerging knowledge of hygiene, this mode of thinking died out.  Now, people believe that 'cleanliness is next to godliness' - Why?  Not because of any deep thinking about it, but because it's an inherited conservative opinion.  When the 'hippies' came around and said that bathing every day and slathering yourself in deodorant is stifling, it was the conservatives that resisted them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religious people are taught in a thousand different ways, from subtle to overt to not question authority, especially their holy books.

In fact, ignostics do not believe that [god] exists, but take this a step further. So for example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An atheist would bring up Russell's cosmic teapot example&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An ignostic would think that that is too mild and bring up a &quot;Russell's cosmic grwble&quot; meaning that not only the [god] hypothesis is unfalsifiable, but also fundamentally meaningless.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words - an ignostic thinks that it is impossible to give a meaningful definition for the word &quot;[god]&quot; (or for that matter for the verb &quot;to exist&quot;) in that context. So the question is not only unanswerable, not only false, but completely un-askable. It's gibberish.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;On the other hand, the position reverts to atheism if a possible definition of [god] is agreed on. For example, the ignostic doesn't say that the question is unanswerable given a definition of [god] and &quot;to exist&quot;: if by [god] one means &quot;rainbows&quot; and by &quot;to exist&quot; one means can be seen by me with my naked eyes, then they would say that that particular &quot;[god]&quot; exists; if by [god] one means &quot;the old man with a beard&quot; of classical christianity, then they would say that that particular &quot;[god]&quot; does not exist.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The actual fact is that theists are completely &quot;allergic&quot; to properly define [god] and an ignostic refuses to play a cat and mouse game and argue against an ever-shifting definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point of contact between atheists and ignostics is the following: to argue about [god], atheists have to define the kind of god they argue against. For example, Dawkins argues against a particular &quot;personal God&quot; in his book &quot;The God delusion&quot;. An ignostic would not have a problem with that - except maybe finding the argument a bit &lt;em&gt;naive&lt;/em&gt; because it's open to accusations of being tainted by a straw-man fallacy. A Christian would simply answer that God transcends the definitions that Dawkins has given and proceed to completely dismiss the argument from that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="675" LastActivityDate="2011-01-30T13:42:51.083" />

For the sake of argument, let's also make a distinction between 'old' atheism, circa 1947, and 'old' atheism, circa 1647.  In the US, atheism is still viewed as a four-letter word, although it probably won't get you shunned by a community the way it did in 1947.  In Europe, however, the events of WWII changed a whole generation's view of religion and the Judeo-Christian god--this is a well-known phenomenon within religious academians who are concerned with this sort of thing.  One theory is that the first-hand events experienced in the UK and continental Europe jaded people's view of church, church leadership, and God's benevolence.  This non-dependence on the church is also happening in the US, but it's happening at a slower rate and is several decades behind Europe.  Other movements in the US, civil rights, anti-war, the back-lash of McCarthyism, etc., have created an atmosphere where it's easier and more acceptable to be a bit different from the post-WWII, White, Protestant, American ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not so much that new, or young, atheists are different than those of previous generations, but that the culture in which the new and young atheists live is different than that of previous generations.

About an hour into my drive, I was heading north on Interstate 81 in West Virginia.  At this point, I was sideswiped by a tractor trailer that I was passing.  I lost control of my car and entered the grassy median separating the northbound and southbound lanes.  As a mere 19-year-old, I didn't have the presence of mind to try to stop my car and I did a near-180, entering the southbound lanes, facing roughly south, and doing about 15 mph. Shortly after I entered the southbound lanes, I was then rear-ended by a second tractor trailer before my car came to a stop off the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stepped out of the car with a broken fingernail.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To this day, I point to three things that, if they had been different, I would be dead right now:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That there wasn't any more traffic on the road.  This is the kind of accident that blocks all traffic in both directions for hours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That the second trucker saw me.  If he hadn't at least tried to get out of my way, he would have plowed right through me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;About a mile further down the road, the highway goes under a bridge.  Had it happened a minute later, I would've bounced off of the column of the bridge and back under the first truck.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say this because, for lack of a better word, I was, well, lucky.  I don't ascribe any supernatural power to having helped me survive that day, but I do know quite a few people who do.  The circumstances simply weren't right for my having died that day.  I can even add that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;with regard to point 1, it was well after rush hour so my having survived was as much a function of my lack of desire to be driving home during rush hour as anything.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;with regard to point 2, the second trucker was simply doing his job and I must say he did a good job at it.  He deserves credit where it's due and I definitely am thankful for it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;with regard to point 3, this one ties in at least partially with the cause of the accident.  While I can't be 100% certain what exactly resulted in the side of my car connecting with the side of the truck, one of the possible causes of it was the heavy gusts of wind that were going from the east to the west, and this might have pushed the truck at least a little bit towards me without my noticing it.  Under a bridge, that wouldn't have happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I fully recognize that I don't consider this a supernatural occurrence.  But I also acknowledge that others might.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we all have stories like this, sometimes involving phenomena that have no natural explanation.

In the case of politically expedient violence, the goal is the suppression of specific problematic people and/or organization. The ideology itself is not really what is at issue; what is at issue is the specific, real-world threat posed by &lt;em&gt;adherents&lt;/em&gt; to the ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference is more subtle than it seems, though. But in essence it lies in the specific target of the violence. Religious violence targets the ideology, secular/political violence targets those who hold it, and the specific threat they pose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What that means is that once the ideology targeted stops being a real threat, political violence typically abates. There is no longer a concerted effort to suppress communism, for example (except in the US, more on this later). It's not that the ideology no longer exists, but that it no longer poses a real threat. So political violence is no longer seen as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religious violence never really ends. As long as the rival ideology is seen as a rival in any way, some religious people (pretty much anyone who is truly devout) will be ready to commit violence against it. The rival is seen as a mortal enemy, not simply as a rival. Religion is seen by the devout as a zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where the picture becomes less clear is when politics takes on the characteristics of religion, such as what is happening currently in parts of the Middle-East or more clearly in the US, where the Conservative Movement has metastasized from a political movement to a religious one, with people like Glenn Beck as Grand Mullahs.

In my view, this directly leads to conflicts, even if it strengthens the group coherence. I think it’s baloney because there isn’t inherently a good reason to love thy immediate neighbour more than people all over the world (other than the rather cold and calculating benefits of quid pro quo).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize: &lt;strong&gt;Religious allegiance is a trait that visually distinguishes us from them and strengthens patriotism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that a soldier needs to be unquestioningly obedient.

I think you'll find the ones I described below interesting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic filtering - the vast majority of knowledge and experience is noise - it is not useful, interesting or applicable in anyway to anything we will ever experience again. Critical and rational thinkers train to develop good mechanisms for knowing when a piece of information truly isn't useful, interesting, or relevant, and can safely ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstraction - the ability to extract, from a large body of knowledge, a focused bit of knowledge, which is generally useful without containing most of the knowledge that went into producing it. After filtering out all of the noise, and collecting a large amount of useful, interesting, relevant information, small bits of abstracted (focused, concentrated) knowledge can be pulled out. This is by far the most powerful, and most common used tool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialization - most of acquired knowledge takes time and effort to think through, acquire, and communicate clearly, but doesn't require very much effort to test for correctness and accuracy. Each rational/critical thinker can specialize and analyze/collect data in one area, and then communicate focused, concentrated bits of information, with others via well established channels where their information can be quickly tested for veracity (for example, scientific journals). For example, we have so far put in, probably, on the order of 100,000 - 1,000,000 man-years worth of research into a cancer cure; if a cure is found, it almost certainly won't take nearly 100,000 years worth of knowledge to test that it works, or to learn how/why it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency of communication - critical and rational thinkers invent specialized languages for speaking about important information, which allow for better filtering, abstraction, and exchange of information. This is connected to the basic filtering mechanism - a specialized critical thinker will strongly prefer to listen to the information other specialized critical thinkers have obtained. If the information doesn't come from one, then he's much more likely ignore it, and ignore it safely. It's much more efficient to just wait until someone specialized comes along to collect, abstract, analyze the information, and then communicate it out to the world in focused, concentrated form. For example, a mathematical researcher will likely not follow his grandmothers' medical treatment suggestions - rather, he'll pass the information along to a doctor, which might pass it along to a medical researcher, and both the doctor and mathematician will use the results of the research, rather than the original advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="240" LastActivityDate="2011-02-03T16:35:04.093" CommentCount="1" />

Further reading of other authors might also be in order, in fact I know that both Dennett and Dawkins address these concerns in their books on religion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should also keep in mind that though it does indeed take a very long time to derive new knowledge, it takes a whole lot less time to verify the knowledge gained by someone else.

In short, the more attached to an idea you are, the more skeptical you should be of it and the more evidence you should require before believing it.  For example, Sagan's own greatest desire was to contact extra-terrestrial life.  Since it was such, he made sure to be as stringent as possible about the evidence provided for the existence of it.  In the end he wasn't able to delude himself into the kind of beliefs UFO&quot;ologists&quot; have.

It is his claim that a valid pursuit of human intellect must result in change.  For example, the pursuit of science causes us to change the way we view reality as we gain more knowledge.  He compares this to religion and concludes that because it hasn't changed in 2000 years, it's not a valid intellectual pursuit and doesn't help the human race grow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although fundamentally I may agree with the latter part of that conclusion, that id doesn't help the human race grow (I'll explain why in a bit), I can't agree with the conclusion as a whole because I can't agree with the premise.  The very first thing I thought of when reading that argument was, &quot;What about the moderates and liberal theists that you're currently dismissing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of our secular ideals where first argued by theists.  John Locke for instance is considered one of the foremost and first philosophers to argue effectively for religious tolerance.  Not the kind that Harris wants us to get rid of, &quot;conversational tolerance&quot;, but political tolerance.  Before this age, governments and religion where tightly coupled such that there was only one accepted religion in a country.  There where a few exceptions, but on average this is how it was.  If you did not hold the accepted religion you where often subject to persecution by the government, possibly even torture and/or execution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be easily argued that Locke didn't take it far enough because his tolerance only extended to those who HAD religious beliefs.  It was his contention that atheists couldn't be included because they had nothing holding them to oaths, honesty, and other things necessary for a solid, healthy community.  It must be accepted though that even if Locke wasn't the FIRST, he was one of the most effective; so much so that much of the philosophy that formed the United States is directly traced to him.  John Locke's arguments where 100% theistic and he based the whole thing on scripture; it's one of the main reasons that actually trying to read his argument can't hold my interest...I can't be convinced or consider it actually relevant beyond basic history because it's all based on theistic garbage think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It of course could be argued that any and all theistic arguments for toleration are, and have been, inspired by secularism rather than religion.  This of course may very well be true.  One of the main pieces of arguments like Harris's though is that you can't effectively argue within theism; that moderates &quot;protect&quot; fundamentalism by providing a breeding ground that can't weed them out because you can't argue against them within that framework.  Truth of the matter though is that it must be possible because, historically, it HAPPENED.  We would not live in the largely secular, liberal world today if it couldn't be done because, point of fact, religion held all power in the Western world for centuries and one of the large components of change from that where religious arguments for secular, or at least tolerant, government.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In other words, religion DOES grow and it DOES change, and it is the liberals and &quot;moderates&quot; (not all of them are actually moderate at all) that guide that change.  In this regard they actually play a very important role in society because like it or not, most of society is religious.  There are a few, lucky countries in which this is not the case, but most of the world is not only religious, it's VERY religious.  We need the moderates and liberals who sway minds not pre-disposed to our kind of thinking.  We need the moderates and liberals who are converting a religious world to a secular ideal.  We atheists can now play a larger role in hopefully getting more recognition and acceptance, but we still need the moderates or it's just us screaming at a wall of popular misconception.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do believe that religion holds us back rather than aid our development.  It would be better if all forms of mythical thinking where disposed of.  Even though religion does change, and that change is guided by the moderates, I think it is more due to secular pressures than pressures from within.  Furthermore, religion is slower to respond because of the fact that it's neither consistent nor based upon evidence; you can as easily argue to accept your neighbor as they are, without judgment, as you can argue they should be stoned by the community.  Neither is most of the world's population either though and this is why I think that moderates are helpful and ultimately necessary to actually changing the world.  Convincing people is only remotely attached to evidence and does require that you speak the language of the audience;  atheists simply don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" LastActivityDate="2011-02-03T18:43:38.440" CommentCount="1" />

Of course he has an inner perspective, and a rationalization, an explanation why he is doing this - maybe because of 72 virgins. But that is very a selfish explanation, not very spiritual - isn't it? It might convince an rationalist, if he would believe these virgins were real, and if he would be so amorally, to kill people for his own pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's get another viewpoint. I'm living in a western society, in Germany to make it concrete, and there are often psychologists asked by media to explain criminal acts which are hard to understand. But I've seen very few attempts to explain suicide bombings. Did you? Is there a fear to find ourself when searching for the answer? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And another perspective: Our brain as atheists - is it different from the brain of theists? Is it different between theists who commit such terror, and brave theists, who won't do you any harm? Or are our brains too similar to make such a distinction? Well, there are hormones, which affect our mood and what we think, and we have influence - be it music, be it drugs, be it work or sports, ... - there is the possibility to boost them or to damp them, and a surrounding culture might tolerate, might encourage, tolerate or discourage them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My thesis is: Observing a coincidence of religious believes and such assassination is just the first step, is just the observation of a symptom. And religion doesn't explain much here. A serious attempt to explain such actions would try to find similar patterns in other societies and cultures, and not just see the low hanging fruit in an academic debate. A radical, nonreligious viewpoint can't accept religion as cause of such effect. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, religion is the often used shortcut to refuse reasoning, to refuse thinking, a joker where - maybe - a taboo is sitting. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the short form of the question is: How can we understand a jihadist without accepting his religion as explanation?

An atheist soldier might obey the command to &quot;take point&quot; (move to the front of the line) in face of massive enemy fire without hesitating, and without expecting having even a single virgin in return, although he knows that there's a 99% chance that he'll die doing so.  He does so because he places protecting his fellow countryman (maybe his family) and his brothers-in-arms above protecting his-own life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most Shahids (Jihadist suicide attackers) do not truly expect a heavenly compensation.  They do what they do because of many reasons: Desperation, anger, the will to revenge, monetary compensation to their family, threats made against them or their families, etc.  Brainwash also plays a part in this process, but this brainwash does not focus on the compensation.

You can have your little card of Biblical evil that rob suggests, and that might work with people who don't know their faith very well. My experience, however, is that when I see atheists attacking the Bible, they don't do a very good job. It's easy to take samplings from any classic ancient text and make that text look ridiculous by interpreting it in a modern context. That tactic will work with the uneducated, but anyone who really understands the text easily sees what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me make an analogy with quantum mechanics. Someone could pull out certain examples of quantum theory that would make it appear ridiculous to someone ignorant of physics. However, such arguments would not phase a real physicist who knows that the given examples represent a misunderstanding of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin to correctly understand an ancient text, you must know the cultural context in which it was written. You must also understand different literary genres and try to determine when something should be taken literally or symbolically. For example, poetry is much more symbolic than history, but even with history, ancient approaches to history were different from modern approaches. I've taken philosophy courses where we studied texts from Plato and Aristotle, and they have to be approached with the same care. These techniques of analysis and interpretation are not exact and are constantly evolving. There are some things that we can say that the Bible clearly teaches, such as God made everything; Jesus is God and man; he died on the cross and rose from the dead on the third day. The age of the universe or the exact chronology of the details of Jesus' life we don't know for certain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So arguments that say the Bible is wrong because it says the world was created in 6 days, and science tells us it wasn't don't phase me because I don't believe the world was created in 6 days. Genesis 1 is using symbolic language of days, a forbidden fruit, and a talking snake which represent order, rebellion, and temptation. Attacks against the inconsistency of details between the four Gospels do not phase me because I know that ancient writers had no problem reordering chronology or changing peripheral details in order to serve another purpose in their writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The preceding principles apply to any ancient text. We Christians traditionally see the Bible as not only a collection of ancient texts, but a collection with a unifying theme of Jesus Christ as God incarnate and savior of the world. Traditional interpretation, especially in the Catholic Church, relates everything to this theme. Therefore, Ephesians 5 which I referenced above, is about God's love for the human race expressed in the analogy of the family. The term &quot;be subject&quot; must be interpreted in the context of a loving family, and is better taken to be something like &quot;live in harmony with.&quot; Any kind of sexual slavery is completely antithetical to this interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1035" LastEditorUserId="1035" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-02-10T03:02:55.020" LastActivityDate="2011-02-10T03:02:55.020" CommentCount="5" />

That so many people now live under the rule of law is a very great achievement, the result of a tremendous struggle that still goes on today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've never seen anything in the Bible that gives the slightest ghost of a hint about the principle of the rule of law. I mean, King David (who was endorsed by God, of course) didn't make the law, he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the law, and the same goes for all the other Biblical rulers. The allegedly wise Jesus of Nazareth just ducked the issue completely with that pablum about &quot;rendering unto Caesar&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really find it funny that Christians expect everyone to be impressed because they figured out that prohibiting the murder of our neighbors is a good idea. This is a principle so obvious that every culture figured it out before it had learned to write, even without the benefit of God's revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1024" LastActivityDate="2011-02-08T04:19:59.430" CommentCount="2" />

Nevertheless, they can't let go of something that became deeply embedded in their view of the world starting when they were toddlers.

And the reasons we know this seem (to me) almost identical to the above: i.e. right and wrong were taught to us when we were too young to question it, a capacity for empathy (specifically toward humans and animals) evolved into humans because it had survival benefits to our ancestors, etc.  Rationally, we can acknowledge that the kitten's brain is essentially a computer, that pain is not supernatural, and that there is no technical reason the kitten's sensation of pain is fundamentally different than whatever happens in a robot or other man-made machine when it is forced into a situation that it is programmed to attempt to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But still....we just &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that there is something different about the kitten.

It's certainly possible to develop maladaptive emotional responses, such as exploding in a fit of jealous rage when your girlfriend smiles at another guy. That's irrational because smiling at someone doesn't mean much. It's a weakness because it's a reaction that would only make a bad situation worse, or a neutral or good situation bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about empathy in the same way shows that it's neither a weakness nor irrational. If a kitten displays behaviours which clearly demonstrate that it's experiencing pain, it's rational to respond as if it is in fact in pain. For example, if you hurt the kitten it will attack you or run away. If you persist it will grow more aggressive or fearful, or both. It's not a weakness to respond empathetically because that will end the pain, improving the situation for you and the kitten (i.e., it's an adaptive response). It's not irrational since the point of empathy is, by sharing the kitten's experience, to get you to do what's best for the kitten. The purpose of feeling empathy would have to be something different for such a response to be considered irrational. It's how &lt;em&gt;kittens themselves&lt;/em&gt; learn not to hurt each other (whether or not you'd call that empathy is another debate).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The difference, aside from the lack a nervous system, is that computers are not programmed to learn that a particular signal (i.e., the experience of pain) indicates that whatever action they performed should be avoided. Of course, as you know, they can be programmed that way. But in general they're not. They are simply programmed to avoid performing the action in the first place (or rather, not programmed to perform the action, thus obviating a need for avoidance). Alternatively, they are programmed to alert someone to their need of attention/repair, and to shut down or otherwise continue performing whatever functions are still available. Such programming is direct, specific, and limited; very different from the processes involved in experiencing and learning from pain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, suppose a robot were programmed to learn from its interactions with the environment. Suppose further that it was most effective to program it to learn to generate a strong signal (i.e., pain) in response to damage (whether or not it caused the damage itself), and a similar signal would also be generated to override any action which previously caused it damage. If it is damaged, it cringes, retreats, and lets out a piercing sound, all to let anything nearby know that it has been damaged, and that whatever caused it shouldn't be repeated (even if whatever caused the damage was non-sentient). Generating the &quot;pain&quot; signal floods the robot with energy, preparing it for rapid action. However that energy can't be reclaimed, so if it's not used, it's lost. The robot releases particular fluids which also help it respond quickly and vigourously if necessary, however those fluids are damaging if they're allowed to build up. In such an unlikely scenario it would be rational to feel empathy for a robot. And in fact we probably would. There is plenty of evidence that people respond to robots as they do to humans, if the robots behave sufficiently like humans. But as far as I'm aware, no computers or robots or machines are programmed that way (and there is ample reason to think that would be &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; from the most effective implementation of damage avoidance), so it's not irrational to lack empathy for computers, but it is irrational to approximate computer programming or machine functions to the experience of animals, at least until their implementation goes beyond logical equivalence and attains fully-functional equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="658" LastActivityDate="2011-02-10T09:07:43.607" CommentCount="4" />

In that they are similar. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well - they are, and they are not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem in the argumentation is, that the possibility of theism isn't theism, and while we are capable of theism, we are capable of atheism, and of reasoning, and reflecting other people being theists. This doesn't mean much for the truth of religious claims, or the usefulness of theism today and tomorrow. A capacity might be useful in one sense, and not that useful in another sense, and the settings might change. Strong people have the ability to fight against wild and dangerous animals, but might do harm to other people. The one thing we appreciate, the other thing not that much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we want to judge about empathy, we have to look at it closely - not just from a very general perspective, that it did evolve together with us. Else, if we were Brontosaurus Rex, we would believe everything is okay as well, as long as we exist. Empathy is useful in learning: We see someone else getting hit by a cat, and know how he is suffering, and try to avoid his behavior. On the other side, we might take too much risks in trying to help somebody, and getting ourselves in trouble. There isn't a simple, digital answer to 'is empathy good?'. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I read 'irrational' as emotionless as I can, I can of course argue, that we, the humans, act emphatic &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; reasoning about it, that even animals act emphatic, and that they don't know why too. That is right, but surely not something a religious person likes to hear, to excuse his religious, unreflected behaving. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. 2: You can't be cruel to a machine.

A computer-speaker, telling you &quot;I'm suffering like a kitten&quot; is lying. Not even that - to lie, it would need to have awareness too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is based on the fact of similarity, so if you see a suffering kitten, you know how it feels, at least you have an idea how it feels. But there is no way to feel like a laptop without power or an overheated one. For a social being, it is helpful to learn from each other, and if we help each other, we might survive problems which a single person wouldn't solve. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But empathy, being shown as useful, doesn't mean it is always useful.

The question becomes one of atheist ethics versus religious morality or dogma.  It's clear from a thousand different examples on TV and the Internet that religious believers have a hard time conceiving living life ethically without the threats of Karma or an angry god murdering them, and the wonder why atheists don't run the street axe murdering people.  Atheists tend to rely on a kind of ethical pragmatism regarding a cost benefit ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, most atheists think murder is wrong.  Why?  Because they don't want to live in a society in which people are murdered, they don't want to be murdered themselves, and they don't feel the need to go murder people.  Most atheists believe that taking a life is wrong in most circumstances.  Not because a god says so, but because of the social and personal results such actions produce.  Most atheists also believe that molesting children for any reason is wrong, for the exact same pragmatic and cost/benefit reasoning I outlined above.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This brings us then to the issue of dogma.  Since atheists don't have a dogma of any kind, we apply the same reasoning and cost/benefit thinking across the board, rather than have specific exceptions defined by some tribal tradition.  I think we tend to be intolerant of that tribalism when it crosses the line of our ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that that point, where our tolerance ends when tribalism or tradition crosses the line over ethics - is the point at which atheists like myself become intolerant of intolerance.

I still consider this a serious question, as superficial and confused it may be. I've tried to rectify some of these problems as best I can, though the question could likely still be much clearer.

Psychology refers to our concept of ourselves, which is finite and how we attempt to deal with an experience of time and space that is infinite. Even ancient people would have had a sense that history went back further than they could know, and of course there were the unreachable things in the sky, sometimes called the “heavens”. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The common interpretation of cave paintings is that people were feeling some remorse for the living beings they were killing. In tribal warfare too, they justified it for survival reasons, but knew their enemy had families. This is the “knowledge of good and evil” contained in the tree from which Adam and Eve ate. Also noteworthy is that is the woman tempts the man, then he feels vulnerable. This is the basis for most of the sitcoms on TV today. We know the joke, but we don’t recognize it in this ancient form of storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what is our punishment? Working and having children, the very things that protect us from vulnerability and give a sense of the infinite. How this was co-opted by the Kingdom of David, or whoever those people were up in the hills of the desert, is a bigger mystery, and unfortunately it got mixed in with a search for how to be saved from this disease. We now know that we all have these conflicts going in our heads, we would go to extreme, violent ends to protect our family, and most of us who own computers and are sitting safely in our rooms using them, benefit from people who have perpetrated violent acts to create that safety. We all have to resolve this dissonance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking for a savior, I think the story is telling us to look for ways to grow, mature, learn to live with these selfish instincts and learn to be civil and care for each other.

Quotes like this, “Ubiquitous and prepackaged media tropes about race, perhaps more than intelligence, serve not as rational arguments but as apotropaic charms to ward off inconvenient ideas.” are usually a bad sign. Throughout, he quotes the other side of the arguments but mostly this only gives the illusion of addressing them.  Mostly he just dismisses them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bit on skin color as a straw man is very revealing. Conclusions are reached that seem to build on earlier logic, but really they don’t. For example, his statement, “A population is a race is a population. To deny the population is literally a denial of evolution.” is not supported by his argument.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have not spent enough time reviewing all this data. There are many links, references and studies to plow through. That can make an article appear convincing, until you start clicking on those links, or searching for additional information about them.

If you read the interview, you’ll see the discussion is about not discriminating against people based on where they are at when they enter into the educational system. It is about removing discrimination from our schools. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leap that you make in your question “If it's physically impossible to &quot;rise up&quot; above the genes you had no choice is choosing, is it really so bad to go through life believing Jesus Christ will reward you one day for your troubles in the afterlife?” indicates an odd sense of logic. It demonstrates exactly why I think the issue of faith needs to become a more public discussion. The religion vs science argument as currently displayed does have some serious problems, and I think you are seeing them, but your recommendation for what to do about it is equally confused.

Science doesn't deal with &quot;unprovable assumptions that are accepted on their very nature as being true&quot;. It deals with assumptions supported by evidence. So I'm going to use the term &lt;em&gt;assumption&lt;/em&gt; rather than axiom because it is a more appropriate term when dealing with reasoning about faith and science in the same context.  (The term 'hypothesis' would be more appropriate to science, but not to faith).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assumptions are not necessarily unprovable. They, along with the theories they're used to construct, are either supported by evidence, or they're not. I hold the following assumptions about the nature of reality:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nature of reality is physical.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reality is governed by discoverable laws.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The laws of physics apply everywhere in the universe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The laws of physics don't change.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If there is anything 'outside' the universe, and if its influence extends 'within' the universe, that influence is governed by physical laws.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also have these expectations of explanations of reality:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Theories explaining events within the universe must be built upon the laws of physics, at least indirectly. For example, a psychological theory is more reliable the better it incorporates biology, which incorporates chemistry, which incorporates physics. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any explanations of events must be accounted for by a coherent, cogent theory, or considered unexplained.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assumptions 1 to 4 are not purely axiomatic; they are supported by careful, extensive observation. In all the time we've been studying the laws of physics, they've never been violated. Premise 5 follows from the previous assumptions. Someone who believes there is a spiritual aspect to reality would argue that those assumptions have been violated, for example in the case of miracles. However expectation 2 contends that unless those miracles are accounted for by a coherent theory, then they are unexplained, so the assumptions can't be considered violated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that brings us to the difference between faith and science. Faith is satisfied with a leap from assumption to conclusion. Science demands that assumptions be rigorously traced to conclusions step-by-step, and also that those assumptions themselves--not just the conclusions--be supported by evidence. For example, faith contends that the assumption that God caused a miracle to occur is a sufficent explanation (as long as no other explanation is available). Science contends that without a coherent account of how God could bring about such an event, the event is unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question of God's existence fails in a similar way. There is no way to account for the existence of God in a coherent, cogent way in light of our understanding of reality (which includes all the evidence we've gathered). So there is no reason to consider God's existence explained, i.e., there is no reason to believe God exists. If we trace our understanding of the world through all the scientific theories and all the evidence, at some point we run into the unknown. What exactly is the nature of reality at the quantum level? Is there anything beyond? At that point the only intelligible position is to acknowledge that what lies beyond is as yet unknown. &lt;strong&gt;Not God by any definition. Unknown&lt;/strong&gt;.

In Dawkins case, his emphasis is more on advocating a secular public space, not advocating irreligion; he is not particularly anti-religious but rather non-theist. As a quick example consider his 'scale' of atheism, and in particular where he positions himself (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/books/review/Holt.t.html?_r=2&amp;amp;ref=books&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this NYTimes article on 'The God Delusion'&lt;/a&gt;): 'On a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is certitude that God exists and 7 is certitude that God does not exist, Dawkins rates himself a 6: &quot;I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, this is what our new atheism boils down to: a sort of calm, even reactionary, thoroughly neoliberal atheism -- concerned with religion basically as a sort of archaism, to be more or less relegated to a tertiary role behind state and market. Philosopy, we should note, suffers more or less the same fate as theology in such a scheme.

Consider that throughout American history it wasn't the liberal academics who led the struggles for social change -- rather, the academy (with the grand execption of Vietnam) has been dragged along kicking and screaming.

To me, morality means to take responsibility for the (real, not imagined) consequences of one’s actions. It doesn’t matter what those actions &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; those consequences are. What does this have to do with “purpose”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fallacy fallacy. You correctly point out that there is nothing in the universe to say that we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be moral. But then you seem to imply that, therefore, we &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be. That is, of course, fallacious. If you’ve shown anything by this argument, it’s that we can do what we think is best, and if I think being moral (by my own standard) is best, then that’s perfectly intellectually honest. And now comes the important part (this is very subtle but important):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My own standard of morality may, on occasion, compel me to attempt to convince certain other people to act in a certain way, for example by convincing them that it is “moral” or that they “should” act that way, even if that makes me appear intellectually dishonest &lt;em&gt;in their eyes&lt;/em&gt; (but not in mine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? To give an example, suppose someone tells me in confidence that they are planning a murder. If I followed the gist of your post correctly, you think I should shrug and say it doesn’t matter because it is cosmically insignificant.

Therefore, given the option, I prefer to put &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; effort into delivering a (possibly manipulative) lecture on morals and responsibility in the hopes that this may prevent the murder from occurring.

Ramachandran explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using galvanic skin response (which correlates with emotional arousal) to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli (Ramachandran and Blakeslee, 1998). By presenting subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR, Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. These results suggest that the medial temporal lobe is specifically involved in generating some of the emotional reactions associated with religious words, images and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscience researcher Michael Persinger asserts that stimulating the temporal lobe electromagnetically can cause TLE and trigger hallucinations of apparent paranormal phenomena such as ghosts and UFOs. Persinger has even created a &quot;God helmet&quot; which purportedly can evoke altered states of consciousness through stimulation of the parietal and temporal lobes. Neurotheologians speculate that individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, having a natural tendency to experience states of consciousness such as euphoria or samādhi, have functioned in human history as religious figures or shamans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are thousands and thousands of anecdotal reports and some study based evidence that messing with brain chemistry produces primary religious experience.  It is well known that LSD and mescaline users report 'seeing god' and other such nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not a far leap to therefore locate the source of &quot;primary religious/ecstatic experience&quot; in the physical and chemical makeup of the brain.

In this case, while these words probably should have been destroyed, perhaps because of them I will develop a tool for properly diagnosing extreme psychosis in children that will then lead to the prevention of such an individual ever coming to power again. So it is the intentions of the man that give the moral value to the words he is using. As such, unless we can judge the intentions of future men we cannot make a rational determination as to if certain words should be handed down to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I guess it boils down to pessimism or optimism about the human race as a whole. If we believe that we will become more prone to violence and intolerance- then no- lets just destroy everything and hope we've taken enough fuel away from the fire that could consume humanity. I choose to personally hope this is not so- and that we will become more enlightened- and words will be taken for what they truly are: the recorded thoughts of others.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I agree with the quote- the first step is to remove the sole authority over the words from the hands of the men who distort them.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1107" LastActivityDate="2011-02-28T00:50:39.007" CommentCount="4" />

She asked it rhetorically and followed up with “it doesn’t make sense.” She was talking about her book “Doubt: A History” and noted that historically doubters have not been in a turf war like the current science vs religion debate. As Epicurus, an early atheist, said, “it feels good to pray, you might as well.” &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She further explained that recognizing that there is mystery does not require that you have to fill in the blanks with imaginary ideas. She lays out that &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People have feelings of faith manifested in many ways, through traditional church or personal journeys in the wilderness. There is no reason to feel a need to control that. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We can explore it, celebrate it and embrace it as part of being human. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Controlling how people abuse these feelings, how they fill in the blanks, and how they coerce others to believe that their imagination is reality is a different matter and not part of this question. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her book came out in 2003, before the “The God Delusion”.

It is a statement about how new ideas that challenge dogma tend to split communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, “Cast him into the outer darkness” in the parable of the talents. Only if you interpret the master in the parable as being Jesus. I prefer Gustav Guiterrez’s Liberation Theology interpretation which interprets the master more literally and the third slave as the followers of Jesus, speaking out against tyranny. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many references to “hell” can be interpreted as “Gehenna”, an actual place in Jerusalem where there was a lot of garbage and uncontrolled fires. So they are warnings that you need to get your life in order or you will end up living there. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luke 10:11 talks about going out and teaching the gospel, and if they don’t listen, “wipe the dust off your feet”. I think you have to be overly sensitive to compare this to “flipping them off” as some have.

(As Bill Hicks said, “thank you God for all those options”)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is strong evidence that Jesus believed that the world was coming to an end in his lifetime and there would be a judgment, a separating of good and bad souls. It could be considered hateful or as a warning for how he thought you could avoid the punishment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul listed various people and behaviors that should be shunned and expunged from the community, such as the arsenokoitai, a greek word that might mean homosexual.

If you &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; morality as some set of edicts handed down by a supernatural being, then you have to throw away &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; morality (if you're going to be intellectually honest) when you adopt atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you might also observe that humans are social primates, and social groups work better if individuals therein do not incessantly try to exploit the group (and other individuals) for their own ends.  We might decide that &lt;em&gt;morality&lt;/em&gt; is a perfectly good word to use to describe those issues pertaining to proper individual conduct within a group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aha, you might say--but there is no meaning to it all, so it's all pointless!  Well, again, depends what you mean by meaning.  There is a curiously powerful semi-tautological meaning in the life process.  First, notice that natural selection has shaped us to be exquisitely good self-replicators (in a very complex way, not the bacterial &quot;let's eat everything as fast as we possibly can!&quot; way--though on the largest scale, we have a tendency to revert to that behavior).  We act as though the most important thing to us is perpetuating our genes--and given that our genes are shared to an astounding extent between us, one can argue that our more noble aspirations to embrace the brotherhood of mankind is just an intuition that matches up with the biological reality: some genetic differences are important, but for the most part, we're all pretty similar, and we're all built to want to propagate our genes / our tribe's genes / our species' genes.  You don't get the overarching morality of religion from this observation, but if we have been selected and have all the instincts and desires and so on to want to continue the species, you'd have to conclude that it was at the very least pretty wrong-headed for anyone to do anything that would seriously jeopardize that.  (Start a global thermonuclear war, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then you might notice that if you really don't care about it all, and don't bother taking part in the continuation of the species (either directly, by having children, or indirectly, by contributing to society and trying to avoid some of our worst excesses that threaten our future), and die, then you're gone, and what you did pretty much didn't matter: a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And those people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care about keeping humanity going, to the extent that they manage to do it, also get their prophecy fulfilled: their offspring (collectively, not of each individual necessarily) are still around, and thus what they did mattered (inasmuch as anything matters to anyone ever, by virtue of it mattering to individuals who are present at various times).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, put simply: we are a type of creature who tries to perpetuate the species.  Embracing this and using it to guide one's morality is about as non-controversial of a move as you can get.  I'm not sure that if you fail to do that one can say that you're &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but one could make a good case that you're &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt; (in the &quot;evolutionary unfit&quot; sense).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we don't really need to make the logical step--our instincts do most of the work for us.  (We care about our children, even to the point of sacrificing our lives for them at times, for example.)

If you're free in important decisions, you're free in less important ones and vice versa - no? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think that freedom would mean that you decide what to do without influence from your culture and from your history. But you and me, we are historic beings, we have a history, we have experiences, values. We have time to prove our values every day, and we decided to stick to them, and sometimes we didn't. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if I do something today, which is pretty predictable, for example I prefer a bit of sugar in the coffee - that's my freedom. My freedom is to decide on my own whether I fear to get fat and ugly from too much sugar, or not. Whether I prefer a sweet taste or a bitter one. Of course it is influenced by my history and it might correlate extremely with neurons in my brain which could be measured. But if I change my decisions, the neurons would behave in another way. But there is no distinction between what the neurons do and my decisions. &#xA;You have to admit that those neurons in action &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; my free thoughts. It's a different kind of perspective, it's looking at them with a microscope. You don't see much if you come too close. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only if you claim that your brain isn't you, that it is something foreign, that electrons, neurons and nerves - that it isn't you, but your brain which is thinking, that you can make a distinction between your thoughts as a physical/chemical/biological event and an historical/juristic/philosophical one; only then you can fall into the illusion of being a  heteronomous robot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't forget your experiment! ;) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And hey! It's 21st century, you just have to knock on wood, not to sacrifice your son, like Abraham. :) But that was another experiment.

I remember thinking at the time that the religious fervor that led those nineteen people to take control of those planes and then cause the destruction and carnage would be exposed for what it is, and more people should move away from religion.  I regret that I was wrong in that expectation and feel deeply saddened that more people didn't regard it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other event took place over the course of about a week, beginning on the 2nd of April, 2005.  It was virtually impossible, at that time, to turn on the TV and not see the huge throngs of mourners over the recently-deceased Pope John Paul II.  The cynic in me saw all of the news coverage as basically a continual confirmation and reconfirmation that he was, in fact, still dead.  But you can't deny the sheer numbers of people who turned out to pay their respects and mourn his passing.  And this in the supposedly secular Europe.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There, of course, have been other incidents -- smaller in scope than a terrorist attack that claims more than 3000 lives or the death of a religious leader -- over the course of the past decade that either&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;should have resulted in more people turning away from religion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;underscored the power that religions still claim&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This list includes, but is certainly not limited to, the terrorist attacks in London, Madrid, and Mumbai; the assassination of Theo Van Gogh; the very public conversion to Catholicism of Tony Blair; the publication of The God Delusion, by Richard Dawkins; the construction of the Creation Museum in Kentucky and the ongoing attempts to build a new theme park with a giant Ark; the sheer number of people who believe Barack Obama is a muslim; the sheer number of people who claim the United States is a Christian nation; religiously-motivated lawmaking around the world, especially in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa; the list goes on.... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="205" LastActivityDate="2011-03-03T04:48:51.120" CommentCount="1" />

In the realm of mathematic theorems that have been extensively studied, there is not much doubt about the validity of the proof itself. The doubtful part is what its implications are and how (or if) it relates to our life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simply put, Goedel's theorem states that if a mathematical theory is sufficiently complex (contains &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peano's arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;, so you can count using integers), there are true statements that cannot be proven within the theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is where this becomes interesting. Since you can count, you could argue that your internal theory about the world contains Peano's arithmetic. As a consequence (providing your theory of the world is consistent), you can never prove every single truth, even if given infinite means.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been arguments that this idea is flawed, since people make mistakes and their theories about the world are thus inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which means that either you are consistent and do not make mistakes and you will never know every truth (replace &quot;you&quot; with &quot;humankind past, present and future&quot;, same thing for these purposes), or you make mistakes and are inconsistent and thus you actually might know every truth, but sadly, thanks to inconsistency, you would also know every falsehood - it would logically be all the same to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be argued that embracing Goedel's theorem leads to eastern philosophies that appear to reject consistency (a statement can be both true and false at the same time), and in exchange provide the potentail to gain the ultimate knowledge (which at the same time happens to be a complete lack of knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also seems to be reflected in Christianity, where you are told that you should abandon your logic and replace it with belief. It makes sense - logic can only get you so far.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find it very hard to root for logic, as the logic contains within itself means of its own undoing. Thinking logically means being eternally limited with no means of escaping that jail. The only way out means to abandon logic. It seems that if we used strict logic for ruling our everyday affairs, thinking everything to its ultimate consequences, we would have to behave like pure lunatics (our theories are necessarily inconsistent, single inconsistency spoils the entire theory, making every statement both true and false at the same time, you cannot really make decisions if everything is true and false at once!).

Godel statements, can be stated in the syntax of the logical system, but cannot be proven true or false by following logical steps of derivation/proof from the stated axioms of the system. As such, any further statement derived from an assumption of true/false of a Godel statement will have no relevance to statements that can be proven within the system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the question is really about relevance. If we have system that is a model of some real world situation, such a system can be be fully predictive and explanatory even though it contains Godel statements. Chances are that the Godel Statements, while phrased logically, simple bear no true relevance to what the system is representing. And that is the important thing to remember- these systems, in the case of the real world, represent/model it. Statements that are purely logical may not have an analog in the represented/real system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A glaring example of this is that mathematicians assign the status of any specific equation as a Godel Statement to very few statements. Some claim that this is because the Godel Statements, when found, are simply incorporated as new axioms for the systems.  This would be because the derivations of such statements would be useful for a particular sub-field in math. Take Euclid's Parallel Postulate as an example. This postulate was found to be unprovable from the rest of the axioms of geometry. It's incorporation as an axiom is what allows for Euclidean geometry to be a sensible system and it derivatives include important results, such as the Pythagorean theorem. All these useful things are based on the assumptions of truth of certain statements- the axioms. And from this view all axioms are Godel statements, for if a given axiom is instead accepted as a theorem then it is unprovable from the other axioms. (as axioms are independent of each other by definition, in the sense that they cannot be derived from on another)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in the end with logic- we must always start somewhere. We must assume the truth of certain unprovable things that are not in contradiction with each other. The question is- are the logical derivatives of these axioms useful: do they represent what we see around us? There is nothing that says what we see around us cannot be represented completely and logically. Godel Statements do not undermine the representational power and efficiency of logical systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all presented as evidence for what I think the main problem with your train of thought is: &quot;It seems that if we used strict logic for ruling our everyday affairs, thinking everything to its ultimate consequences, we would have to behave like pure lunatics (our theories are necessarily inconsistent, single inconsistency spoils the entire theory, making every statement both true and false at the same time, you cannot really make decisions if everything is true and false at once!)&quot; particularly the part about inconsistency ruining the entire theory- which seems to be a premise throughout your question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1107" LastEditorUserId="1107" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-03-05T22:05:57.760" LastActivityDate="2011-03-05T22:05:57.760" CommentCount="7" />

(Which in my view a very strong stance) But that does not mean that it doesn't have any positive effects (just that they are overrun.) One could ask a spiritual person what the positive effects are and some that most likely be on that list are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-A sense of belonging in a group&#xA;-A salve on the apprehension associated with mortality&#xA;-A foundation of morality&#xA;-A larger meaning to the universe&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And etc. One gets a sense the benefit spiritual people would ascribe to their beliefs is psychological in nature. I believe that these feelings would be bolstered in structured setting.

For further background I recommend reading the whole section on &quot;Historical Rebellion&quot; in &lt;strong&gt;The Rebel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He begins moving forward with the 1860s, which &quot;began, apparently, with the most radical negation imaginable: the rejection of any action that was not purely egoistic (Camus 154).&quot; This can be seen in Fathers and Sons (Turgenev 1862), in which the term nihilism is coined; for whom &quot;the only value resides in rational egoism&quot; according to Camus. This laid a foundation for developing a non-positivist ethics, a cynical ethics as Camus would describe it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, he continues with a criticism:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Reason among the nihilists, strangely enough, annexed the prejudices of faith; choosing the most popularized forms of science-worship for their prototype of reason was not the least of the contradictions accepted by these individualists. (Camus 155)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The criticism is not due to the association with faith, actually, it is that they didn't sufficiently adopt skepticism as their model. Instead, they opened the door for nihilism to give way to socialism; &quot;they chose to propagate a doctrine and became socialists (Camus 155).&quot; From here, Camus cites two specific examples that are the threshold of Morality after this point, both of which seeking to rationalize the contradiction of [faith and doctrine] within [nihilism and rationalist egoism]:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Veidle quotes... Soloviev... in denouncing this contradiction: &quot;Man is descended from monkeys, therefore let us love one another.&quot; Pisarev's truth, however, is to be found in this dilemma. If man isthe image of God, then it doess not matter thaat  he is deprived of human love; the day will come when he will be satiated with it. But if he is a blind creature, wandering the darkness of a cruel and circumscribed condition, he has need of his equals and of their ephemeral love  (Camus 155).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The movement began wanting to live life egoistically, subject only to reason, but eventually Bakunin (a contemporary revolutionary and collectivist anarchist) was of the sentiment that &quot;He who has understood reality does not rebel against it, but rejoices in it; in other words, he becomes a conformist (Camus 156).&quot; For Bakunin, evil was simply the rebellion against the divine (or less figuratively, &quot;established&quot;) will. It was not a categorical disposittion, rather a relative position. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some negationists, science was an idol of their time. For Bakunin, it represented yet another figurehead of oppression. Nonetheless, he was an editor of the International Fraternity (1864-7), which established subordination of the individual to central committee (Camus 159). In developing some kind of ethics or morality or any other form of applied value-judgment system, negation was a first step, wherein all things were abandoned to the ego. However, each proponent seemed to mire in their own idolatry, allowing their ego and the ego of their brethren to be subsumed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="135" LastActivityDate="2011-03-06T20:49:20.093" />

One that needs to be asked before asking about how religion stacks up “on balance” after considering positive and negative. As you noted in the question, claims of positive impact are often tied up with hidden agendas. However you aren’t asking for that to be addressed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You asked in the present tense, which makes it more difficult. Religion formerly had much more power and influence, so their impact on education, charity, politics and healing was greater. But that could be asked later. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look around at the names of hospitals. Although this is just big business now, pioneering health facilities has been a traditional religion role. Mission work continues to include healing as one of the things it does. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moral education and youth programs. There is more to education than math, science and sports. A place to discuss just what “love your neighbor” means is important for a growing mind. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Counseling. From integrating military personnel back into society to helping a youth at risk to understand the consequences of his or her actions. Secular institutions have done a pretty poor job of this, unless you can afford $100 an hour once a week. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Charity. I’m not sure what the administration costs are compared to secular charities, but the question isn’t “are they better at it”, the question is “have impacts”. It would be difficult to determine if people would give to secular charities if they were not going to church. As someone who has run programs needing volunteers, I know it is good to partner with churches. You just let one person know you need people and you get 10 or 100 people to show up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tempering leadership. Unfortunately this is not true in all cases, and lately it seems like it is true in the minority of cases, but the sense that religion can give to a leader that he has a moral responsibility beyond his lifetime and a responsibility to give and to protect can keep that power in check. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Renewal. Sundays are secularized now, but the ideas that there should be a sanctuary from war and a time of rest from work are traditionally religious. The relationship of stress and sickness bears out the value of this need for rest. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Political change. Obviously there are differences of opinion on what is positive or negative, but the pulpit is a way to get people thinking about their ideologies.

The expansion of prosperity brought about by capitalism could have been done differently, maybe even better. Many wars could have been prevented by earlier political intervention. Free societies are often formed peacefully proving that violent revolution is not always necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When put the way I put it here, it becomes nearly impossible to answer yes. I’m not claiming to have thought this up, but I don’t a have a source. The consequences of this  leads to a different way of thinking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you are a proponent of religion’s positive role in history, if you answer no to this question, then anything previously labeled “religion” has to be relabeled. Label it sociology, evolutionary biology, or wisdom through the ages but don’t call it something that depends on a being that intervenes with nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It frees us to discuss those positive impacts of religion without relegating them to religion alone. If there are positive reasons for people getting together and singing once a week, then lets examine them and see how we can use them. If escalating a minor insult into a violent situation is bad, and a story about turning the other cheek is a way to teach that, then lets do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to require that you recite the apostle’s creed at the end of the lesson, and no one gets to claim that they have exclusive rights to the story, or that it was their God that thought it up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: Change &quot;do&quot; to &quot;accomplish&quot;.

Maybe it's an offshoot of a pre-existing idea and maybe it's a completely new one.  The idea always begins with attempts to answer the big unanswerable questions (and maybe even by posing such unanswerable questions on their own).  Questions like:  &quot;why are we here?&quot;  &quot;what happens when you die?&quot;  &quot;what is the 'right' thing to do in such-and-such circumstance?&quot; (with that last question, it's one of those general moral dilemmas that are natural offshoots of living in a complex world, and generally touch on questions like: may I commit some unspeakable atrocity against one person if I knew the result would be the betterment of the lives of countless others?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the person talks about the idea and finds that he (historically it has been a 'he' more often than not but there's nothing preventing the person from being a woman) is a gifted speaker, charismatic, and a small band of people start listening to him, taking his words as being truthful and regarding the original person as their leader.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that, the followers start to echo the words of the leader and start to communicate it on a wider scale.  There may be some misinterpretations along the way, but what's important here is not the misinterpretations but rather the fact that more and more people will now listen to the words of the leader -- or the retellings of those words if the leader is not available for any reason.  It may also represent a threat to the status quo in the world of politics or pre-existing religion.  At this stage, the idea and its leader can fairly be termed a &quot;cult&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once we have reached the status of a cult, one of two things is going to happen:  the idea will die out, or it will persist.  The idea may die out because of infighting among the followers, or it may die out because the leader himself (see above about my use of the male-specific pronoun) died, or even because it was quashed by the powers-that-be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the idea persists, however, it is because a sufficiently large and convincing group of people were enabled the cult to grow larger.  There will be more and more compromises of the original idea in the hopes of gaining more converts (i.e., assimilating pre-existing religious ideas into the new one).  There will come a tipping point sometime after that, then, when the cult gains some degree of social and political clout and recognition.  At this stage, it is a &quot;religion&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, once it's a religion, there will always be the chance that new ideas and new charismatic leaders might induce some to break away and form a new cult, which, over time, could become a new religion, and thus the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though it wasn't a part of the original question, it certainly bears mentioning that the main difference between a cult and a religion is the number of followers and amount of political clout.  I don't have any sense of what the magic number of followers needs to be in order to make the transition, but if you look at modern-day cults such as the Branch Davidians, Jews for Jesus, Jonestown, Heaven's Gate, Raelians, etc., and compare them with early Christians, Mormons, Jews, Hindus, and Muslims, etc., you're not going to see a whole lot of differences....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="205" LastActivityDate="2011-03-10T17:09:00.040" CommentCount="7" />

The plain&#xA;  fact is, religion must die for mankind&#xA;  to live. The hour is getting very late&#xA;  to be able to indulge in having in key&#xA;  decisions made by religious people. By&#xA;  irrationalists, by those who would&#xA;  steer the ship of state not by a&#xA;  compass, but by the equivalent of&#xA;  reading the entrails of a chicken.&#xA;  George Bush prayed a lot about Iraq,&#xA;  but he didn't learn a lot about it.&#xA;  Faith means making a virtue out of not&#xA;  thinking. It's nothing to brag about.&#xA;  And those who preach faith, and enable&#xA;  and elevate it are intellectual&#xA;  slaveholders, keeping mankind in a&#xA;  bondage to fantasy and nonsense that&#xA;  has spawned and justified so much&#xA;  lunacy and destruction. Religion is&#xA;  dangerous because it allows human&#xA;  beings who don't have all the answers&#xA;  to think that they do. Most people&#xA;  would think it's wonderful when&#xA;  someone says, &quot;I'm willing, Lord! I'll&#xA;  do whatever you want me to do!&quot; Except&#xA;  that since there are no gods actually&#xA;  talking to us, that void is filled in&#xA;  by people with their own corruptions&#xA;  and limitations and agendas. And&#xA;  anyone who tells you they know, they&#xA;  just know what happens when you die, I&#xA;  promise you, you don't. How can I be&#xA;  so sure? Because I don't know, and you&#xA;  do not possess mental powers that I do&#xA;  not. The only appropriate attitude for&#xA;  man to have about the big questions is&#xA;  not the arrogant certitude that is the&#xA;  hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt&#xA;  is humble, and that's what man needs&#xA;  to be, considering that human history&#xA;  is just a litany of getting shit dead&#xA;  wrong. This is why rational people,&#xA;  anti-religionists, must end their&#xA;  timidity and come out of the closet&#xA;  and assert themselves. And those who&#xA;  consider themselves only moderately&#xA;  religious really need to look in the&#xA;  mirror and realize that the solace and&#xA;  comfort that religion brings you&#xA;  actually comes at a terrible price. If&#xA;  you belonged to a political party or a&#xA;  social club that was tied to as much&#xA;  bigotry, misogyny, homophobia,&#xA;  violence, and sheer ignorance as&#xA;  religion is, you'd resign in protest.&#xA;  To do otherwise is to be an enabler, a&#xA;  mafia wife, for the true devils of&#xA;  extremism that draw their legitimacy&#xA;  from the billions of their fellow&#xA;  travelers. If the world does come to&#xA;  an end here, or wherever, or if it&#xA;  limps into the future, decimated by&#xA;  the effects of religion-inspired&#xA;  nuclear terrorism, let's remember what&#xA;  the real problem was that we learned&#xA;  how to precipitate mass death before&#xA;  we got past the neurological disorder&#xA;  of wishing for it.

So if civil progress can be made by moving, as a society, away from religion- I'd say we have a good way to judge what it is currently doing for us. However, such a judgment cannot be extended into the past to cover religion for all time. There, I believe, there should just be the simple acknowledgement that it is part of who we were and as such necessarily lead to who we are.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1107" LastActivityDate="2011-03-13T15:20:12.377" CommentCount="2" />

For example, we tend to be much more horrified when someone kills a baby than when someone kills an (adult) baboon, even though the baboon is arguably more cognitively complex and probably possesses a keener sense of suffering (simply because it is more aware).  We also tend to be outraged even when the baby is killed in an entirely painless fashion; most fish almost certainly suffer more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It makes much more sense to me to assume that our moral sense is honed to be useful on evolutionary scales to intelligent social creatures.  Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; we are horrified when harm comes to our young, since without young we'll go extinct!  And, naturally, when dealing with other smart and motivated creatures with whom you can communicate, it's almost always better to communicate and reach some agreement than act unilaterally and provoke a violent response.  So feeling empathy etc. is a useful first step: it makes you want to understand, help, engage in reciprocally beneficial actions, and so on, instead of using violence to mediate between different goals.  (Many animals do the same when trying to attract a mate: males have a variety of ways to judge standing and strength beyond actually testing it in a fight.  We just have a lot more options because we're much better at communicating and understanding complex concepts.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if our moral sense arises from very practical issues regarding our survival as a species, then it &lt;em&gt;doesn't matter&lt;/em&gt; when some entirely unrelated entity appears.  If we're sympathetic to, say, a cute little baby monkey, that can make some sense; we share a lot of genes with monkeys, and we're probably better off with more diversity of life (more robust) and it's generally better to engage our sympathetic feelings widely rather than err in the other direction and fail to extend them even where they're critically important (&quot;the enemy is pure evil!&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But why be sympathetic in the same way to an organoelectronic thing that has arrived from some distant star?

This, of course, is only the most extreme example: people generally have friends, co-workers, etc., with whom they have a variety of relationships of varying depths, and who will be significantly affected if the person dies.

The concept of gods evolved to explain rainbows and lightning and to ritualize agriculture practices, then once these made-up beings were passed on as if they were real, once society had internalized them, people started equating all sorts of experiences with them and using them in their reasoning process.

According to the wikipedia entry on this number, all of the following items are religious connotations of the number 72, many of which pre-date Islam:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The conventional number of scholars translating the Septuagint, according to the legendary account in the &quot;Letter of Aristeas&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The conventional number of disciples sent forth by Jesus in Luke 10 in some manuscripts (seventy in others).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of names of God, according to Kabbalah (see names of God in Judaism).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Shemhamphorasch related to the number of the names of God.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The total number of books in the Holy Bible in the Catholic version if the Book of Lamentations is considered part of the Book of Jeremiah.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The current distribution of the Revelation book is 22 chapters, adopted since the 13th century. But such was not always the case. The oldest known division of the text is that the Greek commentator Andrew of Cesary (6th century) in 72 chapters. Although made with enough accuracy, this structuring could be easily reduced to 70, while putting in the same chapter, the numbers 60, 61 and 62 which constitute a whole, the millennial Reign. Andrew had wanted moreover group these 72 chapters three by three, in order to obtain 24 sections, corresponding to the 24 elders. These 24 sections were completely arbitrary, and divided the texts at the wrong moment. Let us mention that the Codex Amiatinus and the Codex Fuldensis share the book of the Revelation in 25 chapters, and that some Latin handwritten find some from 22 to 44.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of warriors on the Muslim side at the Battle of Badr.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of people martyred along with Imam Hussain at the Battle of Karbala.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of soldiers who will fight alongside Imam Mahdi against the Dajjal, according to Islamic ahadith are 313 not 72.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of devils according to The Lesser Key of Solomon.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 72 old men of the synagogue, according to the Zohar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The degrees of the Jacob's ladder were to the number of 72, according to the Zohar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 72 disciples of Confucius.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The good God Osiris was enclosed in a coffin by 72 evil disciples and accomplices of Set.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is the number of the Immortals Taoism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At the age of the puberty, the young Parsee received the investiture of the sacred cord Kucti made of 72 linens in symbol of the community.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of virgins a Muslim might get as a reward in Heaven&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="205" LastActivityDate="2011-03-19T04:15:51.490" CommentCount="1" />

We wanted to establish our careers, get settled in our marriage, and probably own a house.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter how many times I explained this, my MIL would nod and smile, and then go right back to asking when we were going to have a baby already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For various reasons (financial, logistical, medical) we didn't have a child until we'd been married for 14 years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And for 14 years, at almost every dinner, every holiday, every get-together, every bloody &lt;em&gt;phone call,&lt;/em&gt; my MIL would ask whether I was pregnant or when I was going to have a baby already. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This frustrated me, enraged me, insulted me, and upset me. And while I tried my damnedest to be polite to my MIL, I vented a lot to my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my friends and family might have thought I was obsessed with having a baby, because I talked about it so frequently and so angrily.
